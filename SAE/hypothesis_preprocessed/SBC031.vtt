00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So carolyn was really happy now i'm Carolyn looked at her, looked away, and I thought, Oh, boy, rude way to go kill.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Well, isn't she healthy I mean she!

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I know she has our last. She has some ladder, but heart trouble.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Hershey has an enlarged heart a lot to be with that.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Oh, gosh that's true and she's always always having those for me!

00:11:43.000 --> 00:12:05.000
They wish she's she's a disk semi I mean there's crooked. I think Congress here always have get back a Oh, really, I think I get back it's because I mean some people's bodies are

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:19.000
booted. Oh, yeah, because you're tall for women who are about 5 5 body.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:35.000
It's because of the way my body is everybody gets back East, because back for oh, 5, right they're not built, or an animal to walk on to.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
We taste. Actually, that helps me have a backache.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Really just to get down on your hands and knees and walk and crawl around.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Oh, not crack! not all the way down. it hurt but then your back.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Well, you know, when you're moving, you know chris yeah Well, when I I asked when I went in with my arm, you know, because I so much trouble with my elbow, and so well, she was giving me the treatment one time I asked her

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
about facts, you know, and she said, the newest theory is the opposite.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We? They used to say that you light flat with your with your knees up.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Yeah, so that it will curve this little bit it curves this way, she says.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Now we're having him do exercises you lie flat on your stomach, and you lift your shoulders up, and then you keep doing it until you can have your hands totally straight and your hips.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:49.000
On the I mean your arms to really straighten your hips down so that your curved way up. So I started doing that, Believe it or not, my backache went away, but I can't imagine that he was certainly and he was walking steeped

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
over his back. You have to. You start out real just a little bit.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You know, that went away. but you see that's always worked for me too.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
But it comes back. Well, then, that's what you you know different people have different.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I am good Carol and think she's got a kidney infection, Carolyn's. Carolyn is almost as bad as Bar, but being sick, but she just has these little things that come every once one they're

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:35.000
always serious. Well, she's, got a pain and waist in the back on one side only, and she's not going to bathroom as often as she should, even though she's drinking gallons of water.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Then it fat water. Well, she's gonna get bloated that's different than that.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Yes, I know. Thanks for looks like, yeah, but you can lose it real fast.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Huh? s she gonna go to the doctor and find out well she went yesterday, and the doctor wasn't there.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But the physicians assistant looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spasm.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So they gave her some. he, he, or she got it some pills for muscle spasms, but it hasn't helped as of last night.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It haven't. Well, well, You know I always thought they Were down here where the pain can be just about. you know you know pain can be just any place they said.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Your Kidneys are up right. here. let's weird I think Yeah, she's she thought she had a bladder infection when she was at Whitby.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Did she did she have the opposite probe that's not exactly the opposite.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
They're kind of related aren't they but but they didn't even do a year analysis, which I think is ridiculous.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
When she went in yesterday. But will a urine show up kidneys Sure, if there's an infection I didn't know it was.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I guess it would, because they did that, for well, they thought, Oh, they did, but they never figured out what he had.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Eventually. eventually. No, he's had it before Oh, really hey?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Great. So now Bill and Jonathan are natural class, right?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I do it. Then they quit going to loose and every week.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This is grand, so that's when I agree squeeze them as my tax right, I make a little to drag.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:26.000
He must have liked your life. What was it the clever his mom which it was Jack's mother, So first they had to go seizure. but it scared more link because that was one of her dad's problems.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:47.000
One. What asthma seems like we've got every best thing that could be is talking to a girl or Karen just gonna have a baby.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Does she have any already? she's my age yeah I know I remember her husband, the one I know her sisters home.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Okay, she said. they did. There is many diabetes in their family.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
She goes to Dr. There's diabetes in our family needed. did one on me for either of the kids.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Maybe they pick something up in a blood test on her Well, and then there's there's such a thing as pregnancy diabetes, or you don't have any other time, and she may have received to that I never heard

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000
of that. that's pretty weird, See I Never had that but grandma did when she was pregnant with me.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Oh, she did, will you be when you were born 7 13 Oh, so she didn't have one of those classic signs of diabetes.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
No, usually don't on your first baby but your babies were late, my babies.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
None of my babies were late that's what mom's hoping that it means it doesn't mean anything about having anybody.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It was saying that the we were talking about different students being held back for different reasons and about children being put.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Oh, I was telling her about that one of your girls read at such a low level like you were shooting, and they said, Well, why don't they put her in? She was in, Ruby?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Well I said from one thing they can't put them on without the parents, and then the whole thing that current went through in the first part of second grade.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
His first. So what happened? What have they wanted to test him for?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000
The man, and he go into the racehroom I said sure that's not right, I said.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
She suggested he be tested for it that's 2 different things.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000
That was the first thing that said, unless you were saying she just didn't do great again, and I just about I didn't and didn't.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
But I, you know I told the later. I said, great learn there for miss, than he ever learned from Mrs.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Oh, well, probably because he tried harder for you know, and he was a lunch for me, complete, not complete.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:47.000
But he made a big improvement. He made the collapses of the night regular, and I made this out a little bigger home.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:00.000

We're going to go into the show like you know so much about it, so probably that one day teacher, and you both just had a bad name that came off probably just as well I wasn't there I don't know I have several things I want

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:51.000
to see, and I probably would that's good when i'm watching this awful lot, because this is good clam chowder.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But it's not as Good as uncle don me missing oh, well, after they've gone home, I don't think you know what a side of their freedom Unclear made it after you yeah but not surprisingly enough it didn't

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:22.000
taste real clammy and that wasn't all that here Well, it was good, but they did what's the use of having cram chart to, because evidently fresh clams haven't developed a real strong flavor
