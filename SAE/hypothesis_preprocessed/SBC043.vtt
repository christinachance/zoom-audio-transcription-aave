00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Oh, you said that the white manufacturers She came, she told my cast issues. I want to be there at 7 o'clock to go to community meeting. so Mike is there at 7. 15. He says.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I wonder where she is He says I get up I wasn't playing the company until 8, and here I am early.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So she comes in. she's I apologize for being late Yeah, she's.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I forgot we might have to scrape windows out here because she was Mark, and saw, because she went into the community afterwards.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She hasn't been a good boy I bought 4 or 5 pairs of the new pants before I left, and had a shortened. She says I didn't bother to try one before I left, so she's all of them are

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
not short enough. she's, these, are the shorter ones, and they're about 2 inches due, and then she bought bought a brand new out of shit case, and yesterday was the first day she used it put a bunch of stuff for him

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to read, went home last night and couldn't get it open the lock would not open It's just I don't think it came with a cane.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's just a key and it's this beautiful out of sheet leather.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Whether she watches before she left. you couldn't get it open, So Mike tried, and he couldn't get it, and he says, don't worry.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I says we'll get more of the maintenance but I said they can fix anything, kill what they can't think of.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Well that's what I told her I said kids could probably have it out in 35 s. she's I know we won't miss you 10 min, so I don't come over Bill comes up with this Let me add to a man or whatever it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is 2 min. He had a done she can't use it now.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well, she says she has to really look and he came with a strap, too.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
She's maybe on the strap there is a key she doesn't even bother.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
She just likes it with the handle about the shoulder strap, so it has not been a good day.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
My pants didn't fit issues the 2 lunches I hate them.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
They work kind of long under shoes, and we were kidnapped just by real high heels.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And then you would have to have a really shortened ernest She keys wouldn't well first end of the windshield.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Wipers need a white, and and then they add a shift kitchen.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is not a good morning, he says. well this is your second day of work, and it goes downhill from there. I used to stick to Peggy the blankets off my car this morning. I told me that again.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They were still. they're frozen over that thin just that foggy stuff, and i'm like, Oh, my God, why didn't you go work out this way?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
My lantern. kind of store this morning. you don't mind that actually, that's really not good. i'm in there tomorrow. But I just think I don't want to If I did pull something I don did you take the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Tylenol like I told you to yesterday, I, Dixon, this morning.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Then, just to make, I think, you know, and you might be just a bug.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That kind of a fluent contact. Thank you, Jenny.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Is that funny? She went home today, and a lot of people have had, you know, like fox pollen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In fact, after she's started, just having this kind of just not feeling no well in such a near effect, she went in.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
She did a science infection garris antibiotics.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
She's at least like it over at then, yeah you know, I think it just might have been sent around. But yeah, and that was the weirdest thing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's what I did all day today. I had 3 or 4 different kids come up and played it nasal sinus problems.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Servington went about their docks, came on and wrote another order, and called Bruce, and these ongoing flu things.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Bruce wanted to go hunting today. Every kind of promises you're not getting out here early, and then finally told me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
He says he wasn't going today with mike income Mike left early.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In fact, I Didn't, leave until 4 o'clock and they came with the copy of machine so much for getting out on time on Friday.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, then, I said, Paul, I can stay mommy because I was new anything, and we didn't do anything all day long. pretty much.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It was cool we had customer. Can you sell them in that soup just to try it. I tried It's really spicy.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Dad doesn't cut up his onions as smooth as I do, and I think when I made it, I use my salsa, not his salsa, and when the chili powder says 2 to 4 teaspoons

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I probably used 2. He used the pour so it's real. it'll open up your sinuses.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I like the audience. I just want to try it and also try a couple spoonful, and I think i'll only cook it for about another half hour, and then i'll turn it on because we had customer appreciation.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
As we had hot dogs, and the other retirees come and they're really nice ladies, and we got corsages for them and stuff, and they really like that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I just told me the last year you guys could do this with the merger.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We're like, Yeah, probably. but they were really nice and we had hot that I sat a hot down for lunch doesn't even go. Why was it like that guy?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Why waste money on hot dog when I alright i'm going to do the hard minds I told them, and first one kind of takes it pretty good, but they didn't have the other one.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
It was like Whoa! you don't like hot dogs that well, and then we had cake.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We had a caricate from Costa that carries even that chocolate with a cream filling.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So it's not real sweet at all it's more like a butter cream kind of thing, and then mids and that design that those cash shoes I have more data than I come here while we come along though and then it's kind

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of Nice. Why does I do anything all day? We opened the Annex yesterday.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So yesterday was fine. Well, you have to do it was a mess because you're trying to move all the kids's lungs, and then all of our paperwork that has to do all of it over there.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Well, then we moved some of them over them. We were wondering about staffing as we move 2 of them back 4 kids. so.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But then, today I was the only nurse so that takes I mean when you're used to doing that all the time you get up a system.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But it was kind of crazy, and then it was going pretty good this morning, and the kids were real good.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And then I was going to get a new admin how to get her from the other unit, and the ducks came in.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's all of his kids and what orders and every kid.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So I had all these. You change met orders, or add new stuff and assignments and stuff, so I had to take them all along.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So about 10 after 2 I would have gone there. Then I could do all the admit paperwork and stuff seem to go work out to me. I guess I had that I wanted it. Oh, you know how I get when my heart just beats through gas but not

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They wanted to. Would hers do that, stop and then get real fashion.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I mean she would just see that on life. Yeah, I mean it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Just drive it to steal, actually things to your thyroid He Doesn't know she hasn't been and she's been eating probably the same, if not more.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Just her body. Just not doing well, so she's with that heart monitor. and Gordy said, You know they want to have a baby, you think.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Let's have sex not going to have our mother so Funny it's like we just use a reason. all this little baby came in and say about the moment he was a week and a half old.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
She was. Her name was little Mattel, and she was soky. Yeah, well, like Madeline is your second rule, you know, and she shit her eyes up.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
My project over at her second, her old love. She was so cute.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
He was like such an old-fashioned name for a little baby doesn't it?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But on. She was just adorable, though, and she was so good the whole time definitely went anywhere out in public.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:47.000
When you guys were a week and a half old I mean years and years ago, you just didn't do that try to keep babies home when they're exposing these germs but I think you still have to go with the lanky down yeah she's with that and the best

00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:06.000
one officer. What do you have plans for tonight? Yeah, I think it's going out tonight almost called Karen to see if she wanted to take in a movie or something we do work and we need to deal with that great let me down, I

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:27.000
thought. Well, Dan and I are going to sunday morning. so I thought well, maybe i'll get some. We can step down, and that's pretty good, not honey, but has more water too this much. Well, we were sitting here and dad was in charge of

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the food. Then I says, Well, what do you want to have?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And I still have some spaghetti sauce.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So excuse. Okay, I think there's just enough spaghetti sauce for little, and I out there if I take that, and I says no fine after they hunt on it.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They didn't want to spend all like cooking either so he said.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Well, I don't know what else I can take so I said well, why don't you?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I says that recipe is so easy I sat over here. Brune over Diane's and explain the recipe to him, and he stopped the story about the stuff because all you have to do is Brown some Hamburger and I'm using the

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:14.000
toss cans of stuff in the spices that would be good. Then they wouldn't have to to cookele it. Yeah, i'm having a lot of dishes and I used to be out and wide open as I talked to me going out

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
last night I was like we don't spend that time together.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I know I did that thing. I was like i'm like old file. I'm sorry I want to go off my friends every Saturday. Then with the girls.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Then it's like that's why it's Ok.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
For them. We won't have any nights together so I see maybe once or twice a week, as it is, and I said.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But you know if you're the guy that's so important to you, then go online. i'm a sergeant girls on Saturday he was like that's fine then my fathers Won't be our

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I go back to each other more than 2 nights a week, I said.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You know a relationship, you know. Gosh! if we see each other more than a chance to week, we might, You know that's not good for a relationship at all, I said.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
We just should just talk on the phone a couple months a week and he's like, yeah as i'm being sarcastic to make my point.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
He's like Oh, you're trying to make a point So I talked to him to go down this Friday, and he's like this isn't me every fight now is it?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And I said, No, just you know. Does it have to be stuck in still, that you have to other boys?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
On Friday I was excited to go with all of our friends, you know, like a group of us.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I said we do that on saturdays. and I have no we have no ideas for the 2 of us.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I think that's what he's tried to avoid I was like, Yeah, I don't care if you go with the boys on Friday, but does it have to be every funny? Can it be like all of us once in a while so that we still can

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000
She decorates her home in her office by Chinese and that this was really strange, because she's hispanic, you know, and and all.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.000
When we went through our house all the oriental things and I says what letting needs is playing because she must play, but they die on her in her office if I wouldn't water me take care of him.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000
She wouldn't. have had any like so I said what about a nice either silk plant or one of the silk trees that would sit behind her desk.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Then you know I said that's very soon in which he's doing therapy and stuff, and that's a good idea, and he says you know Costco has some more reasonable ones silk warehouse and some of them and she's I think

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that's a good idea that she can hurt real decorating.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
She can do as she wants and performers we're her office?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Course she moved or is she still here. Well, no she's she's just going in with some of the doctors in the private practice.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So new counseling. Oh, she's gonna be the hospital though.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:28.000
No, she's just moving up front to the front offices Oh, well, she's so steer instead you know the one doctor who lost his wife this summer on a vacation she's going to take over her practice.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Oh, because they're their therapy styles are quite similar, you know, all these patients, since the death was so sudden. all these patients were just kind of left on us because she's been filling in quite a bit and that just kind of made her

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
final decision, Because, she said, when she graduated from grad school that's what she wanted to do in 5 years have her own practice.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Use the that's scary to do oh, yeah it says so the opportunity the patients are there.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So it was a perfect opportunity, even though the circumstances are not the best to work in practice.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000
We went, and we said, amy flower she's staying with her mom.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Now she has to go watch, and then, we go we don't wish to send a Tony, or to 80, because even though they've fight like cats and dogs, anyway.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And then, when you're not feeling well and you know when Amy just glowed, goes off the hand look Cuz tony's no you know no buggy and nosey and like I don't know who we want

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to send flowers because they're both going to drive me to the grace you're not the most pleasant person when you're sick.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
No one is that's a thing but they don't get along. I mean that Well, you just don't listen to me.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I'm, the nurse and I tell you I always listen to you.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Do not who do not take You miss, do that sorry jenny went home, and they say nice, and ego buy some water.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000
She says it takes some liquid I said I don't want you going out all this week, would you say thank you, mother.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:07.000
She was. i'm not what are the little kids too much things, I guess I can tell you what I did both sides of my tongue, so he sticks his tongue out of chosen.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Well, don't do that. he says and it hurts my kid, and I said, Well, don't do that it is one little kid who's been really having the problem. The other day.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
He was tracking so well and I said well I says in the morning that if you track really well let me know, and i'll i'll get the sick.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I'll save that track, and sheet and give it to you You can have it then, and you can show your parents when they come.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
He was so excited. The next morning I barely walked on the unit.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
He screamed. Guess what? I tracked good all day long, and then I forgot to turn it in. So we still stayed on level.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Poor kid, so I says, but he was okay with that. but he says, I know I did really good, and I says, I know you did, too, and you can do good today.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:06.000
So he did really good today also. but he was a little kid. the other day, before his mother came to visit physically worked himself up into such a state that he threw up 3 times before she came. Was he excited.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000
To see her didn't, want to see her well this is the new stepmother, and he's really excited. but he's just such a hyper, kid, and he gets involved in it.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Believe it, You have what your homework and stuff to do tomorrow.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, that would be good at diamond or out of here now, I don't have a lot because actually this week in my notes.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Of course it's pretty mellow but I find that whole division can like.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
They finally call me back someone there by observation. I have to do there.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Oh, you already can do it, Not my students teaching my observation totally different.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000

You'll have this morning when I was to Indian so so when you start.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Then I go on Tuesday to meet him and to get it set up.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Then can you say his name I don't think that's how they told me.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Oh, Ok, so do you observe different teachers or one teacher?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I can pick, he goes, i'll introduce you to him and he goes, and you can pick and pick up what you want.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Then sitting in this Browns, and some of the other well you have to do English.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I don't know any English teacher now? but I mean you get bored?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Do that, I mean they watch it. if you can help you know maybe grade paper, or do with something. but it's also going to work for the teacher to find something that you can do, just being there an hour a week, or 2 h a week

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
so sometimes you can't Besides, you important I mean watching the same class for 20 h, a boring just sitting there. Yeah.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So I mean if you involve it it helps you plus and so it's past the time I tell mickey i'm like Nick.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I'm going to be in like tuesday she's like I don't care.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
You just make your sketching? away. you just come and Go as you please. I don't care. I asked him, and I said, How do you got the phone?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I said i'd be there at 7 45 Dr.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Little mice. Oh, yeah, kathleen has since you're the one in charge, I said, i'm gonna be in late Tuesday's. Okay, and she's like yeah, that's a little bit she just leave me a

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
sticky. So I know. Yeah, and I go leave a sticky. and Tony.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So she thinks that you know we include her and things I ended up making because, like I don't care.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000
What is Christie teach there unless I heard she did. That was last year.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
But You've got to English and you've got to see it just by how we just don't know what's going on at that school.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Why, what I said about that kid in the paper who's in the coma?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
He's the star baseball player at bk you know that scholarship to you just want a getaway player of the year.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
2 years ago. I think I thought it was his dad who was in the hospital.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:11.000
No, it's him. he's a mom Oh, he by that drunk driver and his younger brother plays at Bk as a football game, and I guess the article was about you know how they're all doing all the

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
companies going to go to the game today, because sports are very important.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
This family know they all used to go watch the older brother play baseball, and that's what he would want instead of having to be at the game, and the coach.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I think It's timber one of them said you know if you don't want to play that's fine if you don't want to.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
If you get to go out of a play, you just do whatever.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
But it was like there's a lot of pressure on this football Tv because yeah, I mean it's his dad.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Who's the field is dedicated to he wants to dedicate senior year to his dad memory of his dad because he was a star player, and they play cunein isn't that is that your

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000
homecoming. No, because we usually lose a key. This creative we just put like pay yet, and we like beat every year for like 17 years.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And I think our senior year Junior Senior Year.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
We lost to meet you yeah I was like Oh, God but then, I went to the game to figure out what's going on afterwards.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
So it didn't really matter. Well, I never knew I can never tell you how to play.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
You might be the ones that mattered i'll pick up the Jb.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Game. His gate team was Wednesday, though, so there, 2 and 5 and 2.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Now they want to lost you. Gaussian thing Well, I thought maybe that's what he was doing last night because we came by the stadium.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
The football field and Bsu. The lights were on. Well, the seniors play.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
They they have gaining the varsity has games Thursday and Friday, because they can't always get all the games in, especially when it gets dark. This early.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Now they have a lot more games in the most of schools don't have that you can play in voicing.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
But they sure were a lot of people there but that was 7 o'clock.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I don't know what to the game started just coming Their games usually started 7 from Wednesdays.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000
But varsity yeah I don't know it starts at 7 7 7 There weren't a whole lot of it.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:16.000
They'reupon made. me plan out of town team, too, and I know, Dad said they don't know why they have lights on yet, because it still was Yeah, we have to get them on so they can get it going and I thought

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Maybe that was a sophomore I thought this game was at 445.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I don't have one f new game with this next Wednesday I found out as I was gonna go and watch this game afterward, you know, to get out for a run at 5.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Then go go to work and pop. I mean I gave a 7. I was like Oh, then my legs are kind of walking in.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
That's a weird thing. no pediatric humidity.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
She was what's wrong with her legs one that we're freaking out about it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:52.000
I said it was. it was freaky well that's something I called in the morning because I didn't want to go and wake you up and say, how really is I how he think they are my legs are 5 but I need some

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
more sleep, and so that luckily I remembered to call early enough. Otherwise it's going to call you work.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.000
But then I thought that'd be kind of stupid i'd call you work if you didn't go to work. they'll say no, she's home sick to me i'm like what kind of mother, are you on the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
same house. no, I mean we have different schedules.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
But they're still kind of store like I can walk in there, and it's more of a flu.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:27.000
So I think it was. If if you have an appetite or anything else like that, I think that's part of I mean I can be sick to not eat. Now, I've made up for it i'll say everything then I was like

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
all, because, you know, I had to go up the store and get the punch cups and stuff for the open house, and I mean everything looked good at this store, and she was 6.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
But nothing but good to her, and I was like that looks good and i'm like.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:53.000
No, no, I was like yesterday. after I got my car fixed I would took it in for maintenance thing, and it was a free one, because you told me, and the dad wanted to go get that oil for the fans. fans.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Is. Well, you go to that number of grocery store I was hungry there because this was 3 o'clock named breakfast at 8 o'clock.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Cancer group. Everything looked good. So $100 later that point on the grocer.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Then we went last night. How do you get stuff with this, dad?
