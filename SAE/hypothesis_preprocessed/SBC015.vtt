WEBVTT

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
he is a real cheap guy, but so these slides would be real interesting.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah, I think it'll be real interesting. I think it would be involved a good slidesh, too bad you can't make it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Who else do you notice when I research what's your name that's all I want to go.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'd like to go it's an interesting thing huh it's an interesting thing, though, because i'm wondering you know, since it is such it's restricted you have to go through mexico no I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
don't think so. No, we have no I don't think So we have, technically speaking, full diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Yeah, they have an ambassador in an American that's just there. there isn't a direct transportation There it's not. It's not like going to cuba where they have to make connections through

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Mexico that's because it's illegal for Americans to travel.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But I wonder whether this is yeah, it is. Oh, yeah, just like Lebanon just became, they said, Lebanon. eggs.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Actually it just became Illegal for a few years libya too isn't. Libya, as well there's quite a few play, Libya.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There's only a handful of boxes Well, it was illegal.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It was illegal. It was illegal, you know, from like the time of Cath the Castro Revolution up until I think the early seventys, the Supreme Court overturned travel restrictions on the on the passport and said

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that the Government couldn't really permit you from going anywhere.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And then that changed again. A few years later they passed some laws, or something like that which did enable the Government to do feaser restrictions, and I think Cuba and North Korea and Now Lebanon and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Libya are the only places that maybe maybe vietnam also, where you're supposedly not able to use your passport to go to you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Really I mean you can they know you can't think It's what I'm wondering what i'm wondering is people that go to, unless all less often to to Vietnam in North Korea this state department

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:44.000
know everybody. they went to New York. i'm sure would they know and that's what sort of world to see that's what's worried worries. Some of them sure if they i'm sure they have campaign list Anyway, but Yeah, But i'm saying Well, he's the only existing live member of the piece of freedom party left you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
know, but they only went under the age of 16 yeah no and It's really funny that I would think that they would have a thing on you.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They would actually possibly even keep an eye on you or watching I don't know how many Americans have been in Nicaragua. no plenty. They're delegations a lot of dealt there's delegations going every

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.000
week. Yeah. House? Well, there a lot of them are religious, So that is, you know, usually church things and lots of people like trade unions and political, you know, left-ish or liberal types.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And but I love i'd love to go yeah yeah I want to go to.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I really go to Mexico. like the same I kind of like to go to Guatemala. but I think Mexico is like the place to go, because it's got everything it's got history.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's got big cities. it's got ruins and It's got, and it's got resorts, You know.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The Caribbean is incredible. This is beautiful beautiful blue water would I know I don't care.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This beautiful, beautiful blue blue water, and then warm water, and like coral and tropical fish, and incredible like resort like hotels and restaurants.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Oh, when we were there last wait it was just after an election, and I got all these great photographs of voice.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
There's elections, posters you know from hunger strikes a little various leftish parties, and they'd like, you know.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Propose, then wall graffiti, and posters all over everything.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So I took a bunch of pictures of that currently having hunger strikes all over Southern Mexico, because it was a particularly I mean, it was even more obvious that even more corrupt than the usual.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:51.000
They always stuck belts, but this time must be a lot more blatant than usual, and so I got pictures of them having their.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There are people the people doing hunger strikes, and that kind of thing, and in particular, in one little Indian town I forgot what the town was called Clock of Chihuahua.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You know, I mean most of these things we saw in Wahaka, and places that were pretty big.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So we went to this one little tiny Indian town and they're they, you know, in the little I forget what they call it this thing central plaza area.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I forget there was some term they used for the there was a big big business.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There's a town right around here, that is still has a so-called It's built around us a call you were telling me about.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That was like one of those Sonoma Sonoma still has a sealo.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Did you know that? Yeah, it was built around it's built during the Mexican.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I don't know, but the whole town still has the old Mexican plaza and the Mexican Governor General's house was right there, and the church that height of things right in the center of Samila Sonoma

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of all places. Yeah, she can go up there and see old California and drink wine.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Did you ever find out what disease you had I went to the doctor, and you did a plug-in dodgers, and said I just went to some local doctor right here.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I didn't go to village. No, he just did a bloodhouse and said, Yeah, well, your blood's all shot, and you have the liver of a ninety-y, and I mean I think he doesn't and I think I think

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you'd be picked up some virus like named about half a dozen viruses, and said I could do some more tests and find that which one. But for the time we've got the test results back. You'd probably be over

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
with it, anyway. So why Bother he is like that though that's his attitude that wasn't only about him?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Oh, what was endorsed! It sounds like Deutsche. There was somebody right here named Dr.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Garcia University of South Korea, or Grenada, Hey, Grenada in a universe of doctors.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So let's put you up traveling down there twice in a row.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Almost deadly diseases. Are you walking the same things? Yeah, I just.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000

You know I eat like a Seviche, and all kinds of salads and guaca, all kinds of stuff like that, you know.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The savage is full of vegetables full of cut-up, tomatoes, and most everything that you do it's savvy, because I don't like the idea of eating raw food.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But I mean like meat and fish, and the idea bothers me.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But you made everything else. I like you know vegetables and salads and my wants to go and travel in in areas like that, and like not be able to have the local food that's part of the health it's delicious

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I eat the local food and get death way. Ill he's very Now i'll never go back.

You probably need some of these 2 here. His dad iron was his mouthful.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I have iron, too, but some of it is absurd.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000

It's just a general malaise about life you know in their hands.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It never, ever ends get that? is it? the season for your turtles to be romantically involved. I guess so.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
They've been doing it for a while it's really amazing.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000
He like takes his nails and he flutters them in from it like trying to cast a spell over her.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
It's really Why, that's done yeah he's trying to cast a spell over her.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Well, no, I mean it's not literally that that's there that's their little meeting.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
They're mating courtship ritual and when she's when she's interested.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I saw them pouring, You know I saw one of the living human beings who've seen turtles having sex.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Yeah, but there he goes again. He's wiggling the things in front of her face, trying to get her interested.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
He's got those real real long fingernails yeah the males only have the nails they're long and fat tails.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It's really amazing and yet she's not running from him. I remember at the beginning, when he started his courtship thing, she was frantically running around like trying to get away from him, and he was biting her and stuff like

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
No, I don't really know I mean I haven't I haven't bothered to sit around and catalog. What they're doing.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
This, I think, is fairly light. I think he's just crying to check around.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This is he's checking around I don't think it's even gotten to the floorplay. yet.

This is the hey? Come here, Babe and she's kind of shining him on.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
She's not really, but she's not showing a lot of interest either.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I think when he says buying her like that, is it?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Oh, yeah, I think when he starts. biting her that's when he is a lot more interested in what we bought him when we bought him he he was larger than her, And now look at them.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
She's a glutton he was larger than her remember she's twice as big as he is now. mean.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I I just can't imagine it's incredible she's just growing.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
She's gonna be as big as that turtle in the petrol.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Yeah 30 years huge I mean it is this thing this this turtle for like 30 years, ever since the pet show the problem is, is it's in the tank this size and that's kind of sad it doesn't can't

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
move I can't swim you can't do anything what are you going to do when they get this big?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You're going to have to like transfer to a Bathtub.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
You're going to have to have an old best tubes aren't hard to find.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I give her a kick into the La River at that point we can make sure she already eats me out of a house, but you know, when she gets a big oh, a few worms when she gets happy she'll need a vat of

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
worms in their expense. You know what is it that i'm gonna be invested.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You know what you said as they get older, they date more vegetable matter.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Yeah, so often, Feeder. i'll have to fewer heads of lettuce. I guess.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
No, you know what I just soft. If you you know what they do eat that he refuses, which would be easy to feed achieved.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Give them gold fish live. They love to eat they love the only i'm dropping a little goldfish into there, and then, like you know, watching it like like you know, like pick goop off the bottom and do a goldfish business you know and then, all of a sudden have

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
a turtle come over and take a big hunk out of it, you know, when it gets a little shocking it will actually be half swimming in a half.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Oh, well, they take a bike, you know, and sometimes they can get the whole thing down at once.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Other times they just like, eat the tail on a piece of the fin, and then the you know, the goldfish manages to get away and flutters around the tank trying to get away from the half half gone Well, you know what I was doing is for about

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
3 months. When I had that snake in my classroom, I would once a week it would be a whole ritual.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Tuesday the kids knew to tuesday we would all sit around the rug.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
We'd put the snake we named it sissy and we put what's put sissy like right in front of all the kids, and I would get buy a feeder locally, and I would bring it in.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And I would put it in the little thing, and we would watch the snake hunt.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
You know we would watch to see Hunt, goldfish and the snake, and it was so.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Make with me goldfish. Yeah, it would lead only live things that that's the only way they feed you have to find.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:59.000
If they want some kinds of stuff, don't need crickets and things like that, I would put out no no in a bowl, and because it'll only eat it live, and so the snake the bowl was about yay big you know and then the

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
snake would start to it, would see it, and it would start to do this whole little dance.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It would start circling the ball and we're having itself and it would get faster and faster.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Then it would start. It would start moving at the same pace that the snake would that the fish would be swimming, and it would start kind of following it and going fast. and fast.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
It would be like this little whirlwind you know and all of a sudden it would go and you know what's so funny.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
The snake was they're they're very I guess they're very bright about goldfish, is that it would rarely get it.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.000
It would rarely get the fish it by the fin. It would almost always get it by the head, because it was streetline, because it would, if it would, get it by the tail and the fins at all.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It would be hard to swallow. Do you know what I mean?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
It would get all fluffed down. Kids loved it. It was their favorite time of the week.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:58.000
They accept blood. They had one little girl. I had one little girl named Anna Mahia, and she was a sensitive, sweet little girl from Mugmala, who was actually her language was great and every time you know what she would do the first time

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
she did, she did. She crossed herself. she did the cross for the fish, and I asked her, Why did you do?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Then she goes so that the fish will go to heaven. Oh!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And then from that point, and then she cried and Then from that point on everybody would be sitting there looking at the fish anxiously, and I would have to tell them to sit down. Cuz.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:29.000
You know other kids calm down. She would turn around so she'd be facing the wall. So she can watch very sensitive the seven-year-old kid, and she wouldn't want, and she was like talk about you know not influenced by peer pressure.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Because all the kids were excited, and she knew, in a sense that she was kind of supposed to be excited, because all the other kids and she know she was really, really, really interesting under her perspective. And then we drew what was so funny is you know we had like language.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Lessons from it. We wrote about it, you know, and they would do one or 2 sentences about it, and a lot of the kids mentioned.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Anna and the sissy sissies at the fish, and Anna cried: That was like the a lot of them do this sentences, and it was really fun.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And then a lot of them would draw a picture of on A.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
You know they do their senses. Then they draw a picture of Anna.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And what did she write? I cried. I Don't remember what you were? but it was something similar like that.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
It was something like the aid the goldfish instead and I wouldn't, you know.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I would have it from the morning, because I would pick it up in the morning, or I pick it up, and that's what I did pick it up the night before, like.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
If it were feeding it I would pick it up Monday.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I would take it home, and that was the worst part I would take it home, and I would like put it, and I would leave it in this plastic bag. put it in a bunch of water in the sink, and I wouldn't go near

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
the sink, because I didn't want to look at this thing I didn't want to get friendly with this fish, you know, and then I would take it in.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I would put it in this bag and I would put it in a paper bag, so I wouldn't look at it, and I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom all day you know until it was feeding time and I

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
wouldn't look at it. I wouldn't let the kids look at it only when it was put into the ball, because I just it was I was the worst I was going.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Oh, you know, you know, 5 min ago she said she really would love to see the turtles eat a goldfish.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Now she said, this is the idea of his interesting it's neat yeah.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
But to actually see it is not as I remember once when I was a kid.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:24.000
It's really stuck in my mind I used to go to an elementary school that had a pet shop right around the corner from it.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I used to go into the pet stores and look at all the animals, anyway, right around the current.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Where do you know where the bank is? the security bank and There's all those little shops who are like tamaros?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:50.000
That sandwich stop and stuff. Huh! No one. It was on Vermont, on Vermont, like maybe 6 shops up from from Hollywood, or process.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Rather there was a little petstop called pandora's pets when I was in elementary school.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Anyway, I remember they had this fish in there called an Oscar.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And there are these like these these these big gnarly suckers.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
They're like I don't know 6 or 8 inches and they've got they only like other fish they like small fish.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
They need like goldfish, I guess goldfish or guppies get the brunt of everything.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Poor guys. they're like the you know they're like the cattle of the animal world. and bread i'm gonna feed other things anyway.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So I remember watching them feed the oscar once. when I was a kid. They dropped in the goldfish. I don't think i'd ever seen it before.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Maybe I did. I don't remember but this time particularly sticks in my mind.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
It drops the goldfish into a tank, and a goldfish goes, swims around.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Mining is a little business eating glop, and all that shit, you know, at fish.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Do. the Oscar sneaks up behind it and opens its mouth, and like creates a vacuum kind of thing.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
You get these huge males that sucks the goldfish? Yeah.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And then and then the the whole fish got stuck halfway into his mouth.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
I went the wrong way. No, it was Gors. it was going.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
What tail first. I guess That's the wrong way anyway?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
So you got this Oscar they're swimming around in the tank with like a goldfish sticking out of his mouth.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.000
You know the the head of a golfer you can see the little goldfish's eyes, and his little mouth going, and the Oscars are swimming around, and you can tell a little goldfish. I mean They don't have what

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
you would call massively expressive faces, but I think it was worried.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:37.000
It's got these like wide open eyes you. know I was just imagining what was going through with little Marges. The Oscar was swimming around frantically, trying to dislodge it so I could swallow it

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
you finally I did manage to you know like listen it I don't know if remember, if it's got it out, or or what.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
But it managed to like you you know dislodge it one way and then swallow it.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
You know what's really interesting. the snake one time it got it the wrong way.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
It. I thought it wasn't an eat it and I was really worried, you know they disengaged their jaws in order.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:20.000
They opened their jobs twice. This just came up how's it go They open their jaws twice twice.
