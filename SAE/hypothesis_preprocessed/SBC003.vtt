WEBVTT

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the other particular use for the red peppers as opposed to the yellow or green peppers. No, no, it was all salad peppers, all salads. that case. I will use a yellow pepper for this evening fabulous

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a number I know kind of smelly. is not but I got it at a reputable market.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, let's see a Three-person salad bowl.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You want to put them in a calendar and Washington?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh, it's gone up here, my daughter. Oh, Oh, I see we have 2 big ones.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay, Now, how much do you guys? Each one like half of that?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We more if you leave if you'll eat more than that then i'll put the whole thing but not that i'll make to be what do you want half have one of these or more than that I could eat one of those but I won't

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:48.000
use it so you can eat about that much bad smell in here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There is, but i'm probably most available is it the print oh, God, Okay,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now of like diet text. you'll probably want me to watch this stuff selling me.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
If you want you can use the let's watch it there's the latest one, you know the salads there.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Creoles. See how hard we were! Is this like something you had when you were young in your own family?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:02.000
No, I don't think they ever did they actually exist but you probably didn't have to wash their salads back then, because they didn't know what was on them. They were crawling with disgusting tests

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
as a conceptual pesticides of the mind which I try.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This kitchen throughout. Beg your indulgence, my dear.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Here here. Okay, so the decide we do or do not want potatoes.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I think potatoes are excessive I think we have enough food here.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's fine. Okay, we have rubbing like solid and fish. and green beans.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah, we can make them garth thread or something. I have the ideal making the garbage right here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Garlic, bread and butter. Ok. Well, actually i've crater, Joe's wit garlic bread spread so we could dispense with the garlic and the fighter.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Well, we could have gone out, but I wanted to be homemade you know. i'm just like well we could have gone out, but I wanted to be homemade, you know, Right?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Flavor is over evening, just rain food Oh, boy it's really not bizarre.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:42.000
How like the breakfasts were already attached to the fish, or the skin, or something, so I probably could have bought it that way.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That I said I want to be home it's special they're working on reading pre-breaded Red Snapper Fish Farm.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's have you heard about these horrific new genetic developments in in food livestock, you know like they're they're trying to breed like a 40 foot long tube chicken no keeping so that they can go

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.000
right from that nuggets. Yeah, it has no basically no body bones except a spine to convey the nerve.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Who's doing this? This is like some kind of horrific nightmare?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I read about this is to a chicken that's really worse.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's just awful, of course you know the early man probably said the same thing about the first domestic chicken, you know.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Can you imagine if I tell in a beautiful jungle out there right?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Oh, I wonder if it's this horrible was there something fishy that smells?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:16.000
No, I think it's just residual fish smell from the potent red snapper, for let me say one nothing worse than staring like a dope.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But your own girl oh, next got damn! What do you do to agree?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I thought it was funny I will happen. I got quite a giggle out of it. Do you dispense with the tomatoes that I had sitting in here safe as household efficiency doublecs for an angle

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.000
move. so my mom didn't catch any fish where are they fishing like in lakes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I think, at the mouth of rivers of the coast.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We? they have some. So I started catching salmon.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Yeah, and some guy who knows a good thing when he's onto it calls the month. If you're running No, you want to come up here. catch madam, but they haven't can you know they eat it when they're up there and I guess they have some frozen but they

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
have put it in our stockings it's nice to have some recreation.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The most time when you're talking to this I mean this was in fact, they're supposed to go up in or you know, environmental.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They're supposed to go up at the end of august when they usually run it dish weren't running this year, you know it's like everywhere.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Nothing's doing, we're supposed to anymore. anywhere that's Why, that whole climbing expeditions really was supposed to be right in between yeah perfect weather and all that stuff, and they ended up getting early winters storms or late monsters or

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000
whatever whatever. We are. a typical you know everywhere we've been in the past several years.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Everybody's talking about how, whether it just isn't normal really like when I was living there for a couple of years.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It was. The rainy season was all raining during the dry season was dry during the rings.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Oh, really, and really, really, joy they were having a yeah I don't know. I mean, I don't know if our drought here will ever break.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I wonder if this is just isn't the new weather for Southern California.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They They claim that there's these cycles in that we're in the middle of the next slide.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:35.000
2 others. Well, I really, we read this great book called The End of Nature by the Sky, just 48 year old.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Harvard guy who lives out in the woods. I love the road anyway.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Smart and it's called yeah it's called the end of nature. It's just really a scary book, you know there's no natural world left right.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
All the natural world was gone, and 1,975.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:08.000
His premise is basically this, that as soon as the world hit a point where there was no more objectively pristine land,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
When you know they found a little on top of Mount Everest, and at the very bottom of the ocean, Right?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Well, not yet. Man just had some effect. the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Right. So in principle, the the concept of nature as a system inside of which man lives is over.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And then in practice. Since then, which was 15 years ago, man has had such dramatic impact on on what we used to think of as nature, that the only way to coexist with nature, it's no longer nature the quasi religious

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
overarching, ordering principle inside of which mankind lives.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And you know it. thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force over and above ourselves to order the universe.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Forget all that it's now you know the world is going to be kept in, or by the same people that brought you.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You know the atomic bomb and all that stuff right which just doesn't sound like a very practical proposal.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Wow! you know the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in Europe and America are now entrusted with maint maintaining the entire glow for the rest of time.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Right. Not likely. So that was his basic premise, and then he goes on for the rest of the book, too.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I think it's really depressing heartlessly debunk all of the you know.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Watery eye, New age, Various theories of how it might not be that one forgotten.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We're flopped. Well, I read it in the New Yorker, and I thought, I don't know one of those New York articles.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Yeah, and it was really I read the whole thing, which is pretty rare, So I mean.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But his premise is not that mankind can survive on earth.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:47.000
His question is, command. My spiritsually survived in a metaphysical world, in which it is happily obvious that man is the highest active principle you know, outside of the completely faith-based belief in God.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
You know, which is irrespective of any relationship to nature.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
There is now absolutely nothing in the world to which we are beholden.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And he? His question was, What impact is this going to have on the fucks at the endless cultural growth of the human species?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Do we even want this? Do we want to be the guy in charge of the world, on the other hand, is new singers too late. Well, he is kind of saying it's too late.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This is why it's such a depressing book right he's saying we already did it, and we haven't even thought about whether we wanted to do it or not is typical and and then it gets down to you know I mean that

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:51.000
brings it to play other people's remarks like you know the it's all fine and good for us in this generation to talk about savings the way, you know, saving the whale or saving the

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
polar bear, or making sure there's enough grizzly bears.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That's fine. But but implicit. is that at any point in time, any time in the piece that man the collective, you know, group or even individual special interests decide.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yeah. So the whales they're out of it bang and so, anyway, Interesting book.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I read it because of this project you know which project the Hamiltonian project.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It's a thing i'm doing for disney is that Freeman to Africa.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Yeah, just come back. he's going back to to call India too, when November.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Those are not all related languages. No, there they just all have to be in Southeast Asia. Bill O'connell's in the Philippines.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Right have a heat book, I don't know if You've seen what's sew on the island of Sebu.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Oh, thanks, figure that would help arm and store in Tokyo a book called Power and Gold on Gold Power and gold.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It's all about jewelry traditions of the Archipelago, Indonesia and the Philippines right.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I was like you said I didn't like that you to do it?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Oh, no, you never want to do harder no okay because there's no in the National Museum they have a gold room that has all this.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:47.000
You mean not made as well I mean it's just where do you like should they go somewhere where they free slack?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
All right. We don't have a car garbage is underneath.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
If you can save the bag that's part of my which is where landscape garbage is underneath, if we can save the bag, the solution is already plastic.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
That's in there. Yeah, on the dining room table just anyway. Hmm.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Hey? that Carr's good it's really pretty it goes on, and I Oh, yeah, they go in how about that have that? And I have another one.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:37.000
There's a museum called part of the hardship think that's just Indonesian and go through the participants.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:49.000
These. he in here has some theory of drawing, at least art historically well between motifs of the seen.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
This people there's not some with with mostly bot-topping diet following stuff.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You actually see it? I must see that right. Imagine pretty clearly some connection, anyway.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Interesting. Yeah, looks like enough salmon. I have to put the you put the water on the plants.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Is that what was going on you're watering with that is that what you're doing actually you know i'd love to do?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Gray water that weird it is they just go a great way of gray water processing center at the laundry net and the complex where I live like right outside of that door.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000
There's no huge machines and stuff that like filter It nominate their kind of light pump it into their watering system.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Graywater systems are local to I mean you get your own. you know It's not like a big story.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Yeah, you get your own grand water system. Yeah, complex, right because this is this apartment complex?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And there's the laundry match Well, laundry's the best way in showers.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I guess best way to get very water you wouldn't want what Well, I guess I guess it's more it's not that you don't want it on your lawn. if you don't want it sitting around or it goes on your life right stuff from the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
same, because stuff from the sink would be great for your lot of work to get right out there. Yeah.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But then to be sitting there sort of decomposing and doing its thing.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I open the lawn to pin a nice little accomplice.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Well, Well, not if you were careful. I mean you know if you if you didn't have.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000
If you're really careful about importance because I went started going to the conference.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Yeah, actually, you know, Zeke, the sheikh is a local You know the guy who's compost pie blew up.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:16.000
He used the composed from the place next door. That was a big big cemetery, and here you want to butter these.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
The grass clippings this huge cemetery. They would mow their lawns.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:31.000
He would take them. He asked him, If you have a grasp of it like 15 years or

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So we have compost started to combust, you know, internally, spontaneously.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So just like this one of them. Yeah. Okay, Okay, yeah.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Delicious? Are they? No, because the mole? how are the beans?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000
How are the beans great checking for an expiration day?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
All right. I just don't even put all the black things for him move out all right.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So I do something civilized like, Clear the table, or are we just going to barbarian it out?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000
No one's going to eat outside dark how will we see what we're eating cattle.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
You want to eat inside. Rough But okay, outside's fine let's see, That's it Good!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:58.000
But you still have to clean out that table it's dirty, so watch it with a clock, and wash it.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Break it down. I love great friends they're still good left over garlic.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:38.000
So these are just the spices here, and stuff I guess the black same as black.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Erect. it's like purple bangal but appreciate.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Just finish it all up. Yeah, like a little lemon with 3. They're still finger. We came back from A.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:20.000
We had to go to the Ritz carl which will rude off for a event, and we've gone what 4 days really relaxing. You know it's really great i'd have this I had a particularly stupid in this time

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
because I had to be a wife most of the time but part of the time I got to be a worker.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I didn't really fun works that was really great and we're pulling up, and I see this girl so I've never seen before.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Sort of dart out of our driveway and stand there watches pulling it.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000
She goes like this like Oh, my God, i've been hi i'm going to help you, and she goes you know. Of course it's his long drive, and she goes.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Oh, I was just getting some limits, I said Oh, yeah who are you? and she goes.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Oh, I'm your next door, neighbor, no she said she said Kenneth said I could have some who's this guy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's old guy across the street so if you ever want eleventh, you know.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Go ahead and he said she said, Ok. Ken said I could have some lemons right? I said he did. Yeah.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And I said, Oh, she goes you don't mind you and I said, Well, yeah, in fact, I do mine, because I thought the lemonade was dying.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I didn't see any lemon on it because she said you would mind if I came back and got a whole bag full with you. Right?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I said, Yeah, like one lemon left on this tree that I can reach that's got to go to Africa, so I never you know I have to get a step letter out to pick my dilemma.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
