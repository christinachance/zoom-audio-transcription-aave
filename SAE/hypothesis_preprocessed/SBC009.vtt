WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that right? So on i'm doing that right so far, all the way down to that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I think, like I am the e and you'd have that plus or minus.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't know what I did to get that where'd I get that square root of X squared because you brought this over here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You brought 3 over here about about 3, and you have X squared.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So if you want to find x you have the square root of X.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Squared that's all I can't figure out is what the square root of negative, 2 over 3 there that be square root 2 over 3.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The whole thing would be added, Wow, no good Me go to two-thirds here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But then you got the other one to meet Gosh!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They? she snoozing on the floor it's not even when we woke her up.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Chicken the Karate can do side. Leave me alone.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Go ahead and served. Hey! how would you like it when you're laying this might just grab your arm or swinging a boy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This lap. Thanks squared equal to one square that for that makes it equal.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
She can't even look at amy she's just looking like I don't know that's what i'm talking about.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So would that one be square root of one over 2? everyone,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But do you have to do that? You have to like have it? where you that there's no fraction under the denominator?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I mean no fraction of the. So then you just multiply the whole thing about square root of 2, and you get square root of 2 over 2, even for the top one, even for that one.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:37.000
No, i'm come up with this one right is like you have the square root of rolling like that right, since you have the square root of 2 on the bottom to make that a square you have to multiply by

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the square root of 2, and then you get 2, and you multiply the top by square root of 2, and you get square root of 2. I wonder why I didn't hear that you get the 2, and you take the square root of 2 and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
get the negative 2, which you take the square and it comes to 2 i'm sorry.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So let's talk about this slowly, as I write this down as you're saying it all right.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is what we came out with right, but put it as the square root of one over the square root of 2.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Oh, and then you modify that about square root, 2 over square root of 2. Right?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Is that what all that square that's what I was trying to say?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ok. I was running around that square root, 2 square root, square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Say everything was square root 2 over 2, right. But then, what about this one?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Let me do this one. Yeah, You have a square root of 3.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Oh, square root, 3 square root of 2 over 3 square root of 3.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I can't say it right ever do I have another ad down here just the one.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000
No, just 1, 3 or square root of 3 squared of 6.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yeah, over 3. Is that right? Run down it square root of 2 tone square root of 3.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The square is 6. is it? Yeah. Okay, that's fine you can do that? Yeah, that's the same way you're multiplying there square root of 9.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That in square root 9 equals 3. Yes, where's the test no telling and you have it, I mean I haven't okay.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The next one is 5 eggs times x minus one. Yeah.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Equals 2 times one minus x, 2 times. one man of 6.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah, and that's easy. you can do that Oh, this is easy, Please say this will factor, will it?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
You do it I mean that's just wasting time because if it's not.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It does. One and negative 2 is, and I can always put those back up into the top and see if they check right.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Let me just try the one I got a equals z red. That's right.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That's one. Yes, Okay, fingerprint vowel 5 all right.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:58.000
X 10, 2 minus 6 thanks is less than or equal to 3 times X minus 4, 3 times X minus 4.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Right, all right. Distribute for us right? 2 X minus X squared.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Twill that's negative x how do you factor this after you do that.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Oh, first I got to take out that negative one don't I mean that negative over that X squared.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So I just I can multiply that whole side by negative one again. Yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Then you flip that sign over. I have to flip that sound over.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
If I do that. See, there's little rules like that that i'm not going to remember.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So if it's less than or equal to then and There's Mars, you have to flip this on Ok.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Retired. Not really. We can't my god in just a few minutes, because I can work on this right-hand leging some sleep.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Ouch, so you say, x plus 4 is greater than or equal to 0.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So you're saying 3 or that was that one the ones we had to do, or and if it's less than do you still do war?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:55.000
No that's if it's in the in between those 2 numbers you know, if there's like a like this one not luck, because there's like a X in the middle one that's or if you have like one number one side and

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it says, yeah, equal to X. No, that was less than the equal right 2 is less than or equal to x less than or equal to less than or equal to 6. right? it's for the family.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It's that's the answer number 9 I don't know this one.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So you know how to do this one. so we in trouble.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Well, you apparently know how to do it did I get it right we're unit.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Get the whole thing right. but you well, you just missed one part of it.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So what's the problem? absolute value of one over 2 minus x over 3 x over 3 oops is greater than or equal to to dodge?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Just pin out 2,000. How do you get rid of the absolute value?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Things talking you put is less than or equal to 2 over 3. R.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Is greater than I mean it's greater than or equal to 2 over 3, and then don't you have like, or is less than, and is less than or equal to negative 2 over 3?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What can I see what I did? Yeah. but when you, when you have absolute value, you take the ads of value off, you put 80 two-thirds on this side, too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
First i'm just going to come and denominate her so I do that.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You can't do it when it's in the asset value though Well, I did right.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
There is that? Why, I missed it let's see if you want to do that?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Then at first you're right so I only did one part of it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Just bring Nate. Just bring two-thirds over to the other side.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Negative two-thirds over to the other side and make it equal to 0.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
No, no, keep that there. but then have another one over there.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Yeah, have is lesson or equal to no you do third and that's no absolute value anymore.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I'll see We've never done it like that let me see if that's how you do it I mean I'm sure you probably can do it.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
There I don't know if that's how you do it or not because I haven't done this the python.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Would you have that's my own fault I shouldn't have waited so long to get math over with she ain't got it anymore right out of high school don't know above hey?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:22.000
They she looser down I don't know she's eating that bog that's what she's doing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I guess. Yes, how you doing. You can do it that way.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
This is the pencil. but then I didn't get what she got.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I guess. Yeah, you can put so. Oh, no it's not going to work that way. You don't have it in the middle. see?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I put it in the middle 7 halves is greater than or equal.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But you can't put it in the middle because if it's gonna be if it's going to be greater than that, then it's not going to be less than that, I guess it can so one way.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I could do is no wait a minute now. See, look what she did.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
She? What! that sign over which you divide by negative 2?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
You had to flip all the signs over which you could do Yeah, because you've got that right.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I'm just gonna skip to this one no you're not you'll knew it now, so I can't Star.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:58.000
But i'm not found a common nominee yeah that brain Why, I can do find one side by doing that can.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Yeah, but once you just put the other put. Once you have negative two-thirds on the other side.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Then you can find a common move, a little bit common denominator for the whole thing, and it's going to be the same denominator.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
What's the common nominator of booboo? I didn't mean that I met once you bring in.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I know what you meant. I don't have to remember us do anything like that. We'll add it on the other side.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Rs and problems in there use this Oh, yeah mmm yeah here's absolute values.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:27.000
We're here and just doing it the way that you were doing i'm trying to find one like that one. Yes, the problem they're assuming different types that i'm sitting here.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Worrying about this one right here. and there probably wouldn't be one like this on the test.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I know that'll be a different one so what do you do you find an inequality with, and absolutely.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Why are you going to wish everyone right there? see?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I sure didn't see any in the example

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:11.000
See, there's no there. It is see here it is as fit by you there.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:31.000
You brought brought naked 4 over to the other side. so it just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never gone out, and I've never got one like that.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Do that. Can you only do that when it's less than or can you do that?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
One is greater than 2. The other way so if it's pointed this way.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000
You just put another 1 point in this way over here hmm that's a big one.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I can. That was my thumbnail. Yeah, I just keep coming down with you for the whole thing.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
We'll take out those and sit there you do i'll screwed up.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Just will be 6. right. Is that right? Now, what do you do?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Subtract 3 to which side to both sides to both sides.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Twox. All right. Take out the negatives. yeah goodbye back. We'll just take divide by negative 2 you can't do that by X by itself.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Yeah, and we divide by a negative get to fit designs and when you do that it's going to be a, or because if you look at because you know it can't be greater the 7 hands, and less than native had

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:45.000
that's one Half the same time so it's going to be either X is less than or equal to nu one over 2, or number 2.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Any problems with this test. 12? How good What'd you want me after this has stay somewhere tomorrow night.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Ok. expose 4 over threex minus 2. His less than less than is this.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Is this the same class i'm taking are you sure we're doing more from the same class that that I go to every now.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Are we just got the same name, but that's about it Okay, I don't know how you start this one.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Do you? Yeah, thanks. so. but i'm not sure because the way I started?
