00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:18.000
No, but everyone Thinks where you like them we're looking for part-time help, like he's just like recruiting us right off the dinner table.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
That's so great that you can make some serious dink did you?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Just well, I was like, yeah, maybe i'll be back yeah and then you get to like, Okay, I don't want to waitress because i'm gonna get too nervous like kind of things.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And a friend of mine is working there already. We saw we walked in.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
She was there, and I said, Oh, you must make good dingo.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And she was like, Yeah, if you can keep up with it, you can make really good money.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So be perfect, Jen, and then 8 you know and then, like if she got in. Then she have say, Oh, I had this friend who needs.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Yeah, we're gonna what time we're getting up to 5, 10, fifth was your clock, probably what time I said.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I don't know 10. Oh, I thought I said 1015 I think it's in 5.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Another year, too. Yeah, everybody's making noises around here maybe everything. Now the banging and solid insulation, and they put another smelly on it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The best job. Exactly. This is what my dad said about the board for the refrigerator, he said.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.000
When you put it in, don't cut it straight across and stick it in, because when you shut the door, if it's perfectly fit, you won't get air circular from the top to the bottom, which you need a refrigerator

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.000
so whoever cuts it to either put holes like 5 holes, drill 5 holes in it, or cut it so straight, and fits on the sides, and then on the end it comes straight out, and then comes in a little bit, Do

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
you know what I mean. So if this was the piece of board leave it like, have it come like this, and all these space is cut off, so the theater can search it.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm probably the screw drill will also be easier so they only just saw, because I forgot the ln for Jason, and I know he's asleep.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Maybe I can ask Ed. and He's going home yeah he can do it at home Tuesday, and she even took money kills it.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They wrote them. What was it with her attacking him yeah he really worked my own, But he needed they're trying to figure out the bill.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The money and whatever. so he needed change like 2, 5, or 10, or something.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So she gave him, and then he kept it and he'd give her like the 10, you know.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
She's attacking boy. I want my money and play pinching him like making the scene.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We're like Oh, my God and then he's like my Dad's like God!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
What would you do for $10? you'd like you should see what you would do for $10?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And then you got something to be 5 at a time and you'll have to like perform for it.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Neither like it's she that is so funny she's like cracking up.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Was she made. No, I think she liked that a little bus because it's acting strange.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:31.000
How do you? Is that very rude, uncle? Yes, Yeah, I haven't even since I hated that Chinese food today.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The that's really kings which are so far all this food but nothing seems good.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Well, I couldn't make possible I don't feel like anything coming? I could just have ugly cows.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000
How about French bread? like a real bagget,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You like that time. I couldn't just eat bread all day 10, so that we have coffee maker and coffee that have coffee tomorrow morning.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Don't know how much to put so you just have to like Oh, I know I just do.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Yeah gets guessed. So you get it right. I always make it too strong.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:22.000
How do you work it? you just pour the water and if You've got a copy filtering about the whole slide. Yep.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Put the coffee filter in here get the coffee in so i'll turn it on for the wise, or how much water the wire is.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The enough wire. Will you tell me how I now remember, however much you want.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Okay. and then just to have how many scoops of it goes with that much, those stirring their shops a little bit, they so good.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But you guys are right after. Yeah, I would like cream.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So. Oh, they weren't too strong you could just barely taste the room, but it's strong enough so you could like you knew they weren't that virgin like we had like 5 I have a second man How did you do

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Well, I want you. I know I had like 2 sets on my mind.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
He had like finished his when I was like so you don't have to drive them to the airport.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
No, thank God, I didn't want to be like Ok.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Go ahead, but I was like, Come on, You can do a trial always.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I give everybody to have shelf in there for their food.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So I have to switch around because all your stuff is like spread out right.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Yes, it's a lot of stuff and it doesn't matter because then I also put some of first stuff there, and maybe like 2 people could share that, and 2 people couldn't take threshold mar or something like that that's a good kind of

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it or that it's totally there's like pans on that shelf there, but that's a painful one.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I don't know what whatever cause last year we said Oh, we'll all share food then, like when Mom you do not want to share food.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Then we'll chat our own cover and that worked out pretty well. yeah.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Well, you shared certain things. you know what I mean like if you're like like that doesn't go away from different, but like I mixed ice tea or something do that like I bought cranberry juice so fish for all

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:48.000
man, and like I don't like it suit that's a good thing I said it's just like how many what I bought, so I should not that I care if you no I don't even can't spaghettios but we're going to care
