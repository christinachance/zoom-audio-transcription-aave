Hello! How's my favorite girl in the world hey? baby who's Who's the girl that I love the girl that i'll do anything i'll wash her feet with my mouth after a ten-mile run I would

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I would you? How are you honey? Oh, i'm doing good I miss, you finish you, too.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That was my favorite girl. Thank you guys, See: Okay,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Are you guys having fun? Yes, i'm so glad what are you going into per mode? Oh, gosh!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We kept missing. You Huh! I know after a while today, it's been a long time so long, I know you missed like all the drama here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
No drama. Yeah, there was such drama. that was drama, and there were suspense.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then there was relief, and then there was ecstasy.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, i'm not the ecstasy of sorts Well, yeah, the reason I have. I kind of I wasn't inclined to call you because I just wanted to give you enjoy your time.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yeah, you know like I felt like, you know so that's I like there were a couple of times I wanted to call you, and I did it for that reason.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Yeah, Well, the thing was I hadn't told you my period is really late, you know, and I guess we would talk, and then we'd hang up.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And then I thought, Oh, gosh, I forgot to tell you that you need to ask you're robbed, Mary.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You haven't had a yet no I mean and it's been so long, and so it's like 8 days late, and I thought i'm sure i'm pregnant i'm positive and I was waiting till you got here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to even try to check. Yeah, and so we went to go get an ept at pregnancy test.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And then we that's why, we're calling you last night you know.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then, of course, it came out fine so that came on negative Yeah, So that's the relief in the ecstasy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So you can't be pregnant no I don't know I unless it was a false negative.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But I doubt rare, right right. I think that would be really rare.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So you know what I mean, like can would it come out negative to say you if you were pregnant, and it's early early early stages, like like what a negative you know what i'm saying is It possible you could still be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
positive I think there'd be a slight chance of it being a false negative.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But I don't think so because i'm pretty late and I think i'm late enough where I would have like enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test tests for I think I would have enough of that in

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
my urine that of course it would show up if I had any in there. Yeah, you know. So I I took that as a pretty good sign, honey.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I can even keep you all. listened I know I didn't mean to keep it inside.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I mean I didn't really love me I didn't mean to not tell you at all.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It was just we would hang up the phone then I thought Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that i'm kind of late, because I didn't think it was a huge deal, but then I guess I wasn't trying.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I think I was in the bit of denial like I wasn't really thinking about it much, you know, because I knew when school got here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Then I would go get the test. So is that all the drama that was the drama?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And that was the suspense, and that was the relief, and that was the ecstasy.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Really. Oh, honey, little bunny's going through the whole wide spectrum of emotions.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You're doing it without me? solo on this it was so funny last night, like what if it came back positive?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then that would mean the next time I talked to i'd be telling you that I was pregnant and then I thought Gosh! Portuguese, like I hadn't given you any like you know like I hadn't warned you or

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
anything, and it would have been such a surprise, totally that Oh, my gosh!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I was even gonna bring the camera into the bathroom to take a picture of the Epp.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Because I thought you know it's like such a momentous occasion like when we came out positive, and then I thought of course, like i'm no, I wouldn't have it or anything but I thought if the slight chance I would have it and

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
it really became a person someday wouldn't they love to see the photograph of the Ept.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
With the positive sign on it, knowing that that was like its first sign of life.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oh, my God! and that's crazy it's not my idea of a good time right now, and we somewhere down the road.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But right now it kind of makes me sick. I know me, too.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I was very, but it was just thought that went through my head No, that's a very cute thought this talk that up with a very cute.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You know me in cameras? Oh, I know. So how are you?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
No team better. What you can do like a self-timer, the self-timer with you right next to it. you know I'm the mom, you know.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Oh, gosh! next to the result, and that could even send it to Ept.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yeah, for advertising fact. I could send it to you because I have it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The test right there, anyhow. So how are you outside of that?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Good. good. We had such a nice day it's really beautiful Here it is.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Like 70 degrees and sunny, and we walked around.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We went to a park, and we just talk doctors that in the sun, and we had such a nice day.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000

Norm Norm Nixon as a basketball player it's a norm instead of like present, all right from Nixon to like Rush Limbaugh to a portion.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The capital pishan yeah yeah you know and so funny because he's he's a catholic, and you know like i'd nailed him on the contradiction or he'd like pro capital punishment

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but and pro-life as to try to explain that to me how to understand.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Well, he said, he's, pro-capital punishment and pro life right? that's like to me that's like a huge contradiction.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And he said he justified it as well see the those little went to a little embrace.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You're kidding. I had no idea where he was going by himself all by himself, and he found a cabin.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000
He called me. he found a cabin like overlooking Big Bear Lake, and it's like just the cabin with like 4 beds in it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But you know, because nobody's up there now so you got it for 55 bucks a night, and he's staying there for a few nights all by himself.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000
He just wants to be up in the mountain too much to write, and just you know the you know, getting tuned with with the himself.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Did he want you to go with him. Oh, no I couldn't go.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I think he was trying to get a girl to go with him.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So he went from like the romantic sexual. getaway to you know a soul searching bond with nature type of deal right? I hope he's not disappointed. Oh, no, that sounds great.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I mean that sounds no. it reminds me of us, getting away like that.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Just get away. i'd love to you know I was talking to Kara tonight.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Oh, she must be so excited, though. Well, she sounded really bound actually, just because school is so tough right now.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But yeah, only 2 more weeks that's a fast knuckle school year.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Wow! When did they start? It was really quick. I think like mid august.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Yeah, or maybe maybe is the beginning of August. Maybe the beginning.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Did she ask you about what you thought of my going up no she didn't.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We didn't talk long at all. she had to go like she was in the middle of studying.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Oh, yeah, think she was serious. Yeah, just totally good girl. Yeah.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yeah, of what we talk about here. Yeah. Let me think of some good way. convince it down to a minute.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Okay. We said something so funny today, and I thought when said it, it captured you so well, and we both laughed because I think it was just so funny how well we both know. you.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I guess we were talking about. I don't know what came out we were talking about Tv or television shows.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And I mentioned, Yeah, you really, You like to watch Mash?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And she laughed and said, Yeah, can't you just picture Jeff sitting on his couch and watching Mash with some orange juice with ice cubes, and we started laughing in what That's slice of heaven like

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
little piece of heaven, and we just thought it was so funny because, like it really captured you.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We both know You'd be sitting there with orange juice with ice cube. Only I haven't had ice cubes here since September are you serious. Yeah, because you mean how big the freezer gets

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I just don't even bother I just keep it at a high temperature.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I keep it really cool. So it's cold enough for me to So you're absolutely right.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I drink orange juice, but I go through like a carton of orange juice every 2 days, honey.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Steph! Oh, the old lady! it's looked at me you know what I just realized.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
She looked at me. she's walking down the stairs she looked at me, and she she didn't see me.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Yeah, I waited her, and she just kept going maybe if there's a reflection or something.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
What a body she has it's an incredible art body's gonna do that.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
She's evolving, you know like 20 generating degenerate.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Yeah, it's kind of weird, Huh! the whole cycle of life what I fucking trip.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Oh, but I I know you. You get excited about things like this, too.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But did you read in the paper about the planets circulating around other stars?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:33.000
No what about pairs. you're you're a you're there's proof. So what's the word that goes before irrefutable irrefutable Where I think is Yeah, thank you Okay, what a

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
good team we are. I could just see myself like flexuring to a bunch of people and like Oh, honey, by the way, what's that word?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
That that goes before. beautiful! Oh, yes, yes, yes, thank you very much.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:16:00.000
What would I do without her? Well, that's funny yeah honey Wouldn't that be funny like if someone was like staring, and they said they like to say that's my wife here.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
She raises her hand. Oh, honey, what were we talking about the other night, you know, wouldn't the whole place just laugh.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah, Okay, I'm talking about it wouldn't the whole place Just laugh. Yeah, I think it's so funny. Okay, anyway. Can I run this fly?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You there's the scientist that came up with earfutable proof that there are. they.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
They found 2 planets circulating around, or a farm in the universe outside of our solar system.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Really and so, which like made me think you know like you know how like we've always talked about life being out there, you know, like there has to be, because there's planets evolving around various stars and stuff just like ours and

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But see, I never knew that that was just a theory. You know a theory that there were planets going around other stars.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000
You mean you actually thought that we had seen this before no no actually I didn't. I just I just thought that it was like pretty much factual.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Oh, yeah, not at all. So you know so it's kind of like a leap of faith.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:20.000
You know that we've always thought that you know I mean like like the scientist who does. can't really prove it like they? they make this leap of faith, you know they just assume right that there were planets and around other

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
sons right right, just by the sheer numbers, they thought.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Well, what are the chances, you know? If we have billions and millions of stars, then chances are, you know, even if it takes like one in 1,000,000 chance for there to be another planetary system.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Well like, Will we have millions of millions and billions of opportunities to have that happen.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So I think that's the whole thing. like carl Sagan would always go yeah billions and billions like he would say that I think he would say that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
But yeah, so, anyhow, like in what Galaxy like what solar, what what galaxy was this star Santa Barbara?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I'm not sure I don't know the the details but anyway, what it made me think about was the fact that you know how you always This might sound a little silly, but you know how like you like I i'm very

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:29.000
passionate about certain ideas. how and then you're like more scientific or you're more open to other possibilities, just even with people.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
But with that like you would like, you would ask like, How do you know?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
For sure you know and it's like like I don't know Where was I going with that that And now here it is.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Here's the factual proof and so that can be satisfied.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Yeah, Well, just to show you that, you know, like you can make an assumption, and you can assume something that feels, you know, really correct.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And it turns out to be that way. Sure, some of the time.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah, I feel like Well, if you also felt that I don't know you could feel something that's wouldn't be proved right.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Yeah, but no, but I think it's so exciting honey. I didn't see that in the newspaper.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It's. Okay, sweetie. Oh, it was more exciting when I was thinking about it the other night.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:32.000
No, it's so exciting I mean I I don't mind no idea about. I mean it's so exciting that I don't even believe you like I think it's that exciting.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Oh, my God they believe me no it's so exciting that I feel like I want to go read it in the newspaper for myself like I can't believe it like how come It's not on the news and I know there aren't like parties now I

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:58.000
don't, and they even they've been studying the 2 planets and their patterns, and how they like they they circle their star, and they think that there's not it can't those planets can't

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:10.000
sustain life. Oh, just from the distance from it know from from their surface the planet's surface can see that Well, it's weird.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
They get it from like they pick up heat waves you know and it's Obviously they can't see really see anything. The only way they can tell that the plants are out there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Like they can tell like the stars are out there just by radio waves. and and you know what that's so incredible, and he weighs that it's unbelievable how man has you know like from this little point in

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
the whole universe like we've been able to tell so much just with science.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I know in a while, just with oh, that's so incredible Sends me out there. Oh, oh, wow!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
That's so exciting honey you're not pregnant.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000
No, you would convince. Your friends only got convinced the moment before I was waiting for the result.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Like all before that. Well, i'm late, but I don't feel any of the symptoms.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
But I got so nervous right when I was taking the test.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I was kind of not treating it taking it that seriously because it's just it's such an unbelievable concept to think that maybe I would be pregnant so I wasn't really believing it and then But

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
the moment that I did the test, I got so scared that oh, my God!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Like this isn't kidding around like what if I am and it's a distinct possibility and I got so scared like you crying.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:51.000
No, I don't cry, but was here like shoot it was so scary, and but you know we were watching it, and it didn't turn blue or no, you know so it was you know. Are you sure it would have been mine.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I would have denied it if you you said it was mine.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:18.000
I was messing around with the repairman her knee Hang me! i'm just kidding love you sure learn a lot about me if that happened. Oh, honey, that would just like ruin your whole idea of who I am it would just like

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I just blow up everything that we had. If I I was not cruel, you just refuted it, I said.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
No way not taking any responsibility if it's mine then it's your fault for getting pregnant.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Do you think we'd be able to make it through that would you be able to look above that just let that one thing pass.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Yeah, no way. I wouldn't let you well I just want you to get pregnant, so you can see how i'm going to take it.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I love you to support you. the money, great happiness, but a pain in the ass that would be.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I know you know what I think out of anything it would just be that would bother me just like I don't have the time to deal with it, You know, like what it's no pain in the neck we have to be really safe this

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
summer. Oh, honey, a shirt? Yeah, Yeah, totally it's and what are we going to use? condoms?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Well, well, they're coming out with condoms for women all right.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
I would never in a 1,000,000 years expect you to wear something like that, honey.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I swear to God I don't always have contraption ever.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Yeah, I just saw one the other day actually they're strange looking. Wow!

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:09.000
We had a woman, a physician, come and talk to us about all the different kinds of contraception, and to tell us about our U 486.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Is that the job to tell us about that, and nor plant, and the side effects of everything?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And it was so interesting. Yeah, what are you 46 is that going to be implemented?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Well, it's not it's not available here in the United States only in France, England. and yet Sweden let me does that. Are they?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Are there people trying to make it law here? think so? But I just think you know politically, I I know, and it will be for a while such a bummer, such a great you know, That would be so great if people could get that stay away

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
from those pro-lifers throwing things in them.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I know guys, you know it's really I think i'm gonna go like rescue duel, because she's been there, and she's really doesn't know anybody and you know can honey, you're

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
