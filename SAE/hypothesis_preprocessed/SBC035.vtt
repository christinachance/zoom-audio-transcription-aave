WEBVTT

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You can't get your rest I know but Well, the I say yes you can, because they have all these groups that say that if you take their classes and they go out of the test.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can raise your oints, you can raise your plans.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What are you keyboard itself is yeah but that's just by learning tricks.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I know the tricks are that's all you have to remember the sat is not a full measure of who you are your creativity.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I know also i'm not saying that but I Do need to have a better sat score for applications.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to write it up which the same squares 10Â s.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, you'd only take it at once I think clarical errors, have I? said i'll be happy to get 700?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I mean, yeah, people in my school are actually like Oh, you'll be taking them.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But then, like my friends, who have like 1350 on that, cannot take care of yourself.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You are already you you can't do that when what what what what?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
1,570 like you make me sick hands on hair your side of fun. That's like how do you think I, when you learn that you can't compare you'll really be grown up you are uniquely new

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and you're not like the idiot I do need to bring them up, for the fact that other people on higher scores is that I do need to bring them up from 170.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If I want to have a better chance than getting here on the front, where you can go upstairs and you'll see it on the right. It's like a school called Adrian college in Michigan.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Sent you a lot of information. Sounds like a little scott I don't have that many.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:03:05.000
May I there. But, Mom, if I want to go to a big school that's my choice.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If i'm willing to pay for it it's cheaper to go to a university than it is to go to a private school Mom Pence, where you feel comfortable, and you're getting on a campus sometimes I think it might Yeah, you have

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to go. you feel like, hey? I like this place I think I could Laura, you think I don't I don't feel calm. no hair, and that's what has to be your fireball? Oh, Yeah, I know it's it has what

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you want, but you feel good about it you walk on campus and you think, Hey, there's something about this place done this.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You don't know that until you're on the I thought about the school round.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can always apply, and the chances of me getting in there are like Zilch.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000
What do they require? the people that I have met them have 4 point zero's?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Okay, are you at fancy study You know that's basically they were in my telephoneer.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The 3 quads like the embryo yeah it comes down some past 4 years.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But yeah, i've been telling you for 4 years. you got to work hard. Now stands I don't little near you. The inner gear was so good-looking.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Hello, this young attorney, who was really young, and I had my interview in the Us.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Steel building, and I went up there. But you know what they asked me.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Some really weird I know, like they. I expected to go in there and talk about. You know my life, and what I want to have in school, and what I expected from them.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They asked me what my stance was on abortion.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Well, that was a dumb question. mercy on question so I think that's a dumb one to ask it's control.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They asked me that, and they were not about drug testing in the workplace. Very personal.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Well, you know it's money is you know bc is Catholic school, and I, you know I don't think they literally like my answer.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But you have, but you still have freedom of Gmail.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That is the same way, because we went and he applied to Williams and she got waitlisted, and lions used to be real, you know, Liberal, whatever. but lately the information we're sending on is nice following community moral

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:04.000
stance there's nothing wrong. Oh, no but but my mom what I'm saying is years ago they had the citizens everything, you know real liberal.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
No conservative when she was interviewed for it. they took her answers very slowly, and they waitlisted her.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
She had the grades which she had the vertical beers, and that's what was how maybe she was better to be in a place where oh, yeah, this is great!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Sheen things work out sometimes with the bestest baby Oh, she is much happier. and she's happy in Texas.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
She's really happy there where is rice it's Houston.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
She. she loves it There they! Their admissions were higher than Margaret.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Really have any trouble deciding well sometimes you don't so I are lucky.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
They always know where they are. with that or what they. I was probably the hardest person to find a scroll, for, because everyone in my family knew what they want.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:20.000
A major. She has no experience at best in my eyes I have door What's your I want to be a social worker.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I that's what she should be and she loves to talk to people That's where she should be.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But if I have the best job on earth, so if you want to get into something I have get into what i'm getting. I drive here. I have. Well, I think the important thing that maybe we should all say you and you need to listen is you have to keep an

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
open mind don't cross any school out before it's right you know. Don't cross off to Geneva before you go there.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I'm not i'm know it's far away it's not a big town, but don't already think I don't want to go there because it's not near a big metropolitan area you know she

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
wasn't near a big metropolitan area, but I had thought that I wanted to be near big area.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But I also house on the campus a lot. They all have coffee.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:54.000
They all do things, you know. They it ended up. I wondered if you were at the top.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Whoa being, I mean it, doesn't really matter the atmosphere.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Eventually it doesn't matter the atmosphere because eventually it's the people that you mean you're ready professors that might be your classes itself.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That really become important, you know, and that should be your first priority.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Yeah, and that all me what you do extracurricular can't be violent because that's not what you're there for if you're not in your setting you're not tell you what that if

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you're going to call it to have a good time one year's all i'm saying like you don't have to be near a big city and wasn't near a big city mom.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It's a little different. i'm a different person I have always like staying here at night.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It'll be very true, city. Why, parent, you look at hey? You'll be away from parents, anyway.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
No, It's like what kind of cities do you like big cities like Chicago, or like she's never been in a big city like Chicago.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:25.000
She ask you a long life. I join around la that tells me about a big city, and that's pretty scary.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000

So here we are, stuck in this huge line of traffic, and we wanted to turn around. But you couldn't make a left turn because they had parking going on.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
