WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
even those feet are probably all over the place. How could he do the three-year-olds a Tap Dan really who suggested this to him? I have no idea it was probably my sister-in-law's idea.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Because I think they saw that movie tap right then the movie with that really hot tent for that kid.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He was actually here 2 weeks ago. Yeah, he's a teenager, but he you seen them? No, I just read an article on him. You probably read the same exam in your article.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yeah, he doesn't realize a human being can't chat right? I think we're talking about how he's teaching these classes, and I guess he really goes fast. Yeah, you can't handle it down.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
To like one fifth speed, or something before they can pick it I'm.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Sure Thomas is all over wondering about those like yeah that's what I can see is being hauled around the whole wack and the zip.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yes, it's just like grow back really fast i'm really soft to start with.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I made it rubber. that's it that's Why, little kids usually don't break their legs, anyway. but they are more currently Arctic.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Yeah, there's this calcium in departments but also there's still a growing, and the way bone and grow is you make car lich, and then you advise the calcium in it. So that's why they always have more

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
flexibility, because there's a growing you're making perlit.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So they always have that until they reach it. over which case they do create stops.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:20.000
That, too. What do you plan on doing with dancing you're taking some fast as last fall?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'll take a few more as well turns out as a spouse.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I get in free all right. So a great class Oh, really that's why you married her.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Oh, I cannot believe you Aren't you guys gonna stick out for me, and be that bonnie or something he's bigger than you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
No, my friends, and we all see that I still got for you today at that store.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
That's true. you did you made me get the image for the green scarf.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
That's right, he's my fashion consultant today I wasn't.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That's right I don't know where it is done store, and the clerk kept trying to keep us interested while she was buying.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Know how to try and the men's close i'm going to suggest it that so you wouldn't be so bored.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So they tried on the men's clothes, and had very small selection of men's clothes.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They tried these really great pants, and looked really good in them so they didn't buy them.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You have. boys are, and everybody kind of broke broke. Students are appropriate.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Is that there is a tape that's a tape where is it coming from with the speakers?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You know these boxes you must have get stereo because I feel like I'm.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Here we have a These are like we're all relevant speakers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
These are the shiny speakers on earth besides one room and kids.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I thought that was a real thing. Think we have like a kid that was going to say, Is there somebody downstairs playing?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And that was when I first thought. but it's like the riots. Come on, let's go to the other store.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
For some reason sound like was out there's also parties across the street.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.000
That's fun, too. and teenagers kissing each other on the side of more gives sight peak backyard and the frontier.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So I so what if it's like well I went out one morning I saw all around it was like on the back bumper of the honda, too.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So I thought ocean, or try to wipe that off like I got one out of wet rag and wiped it off the car, and it came off really easily.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And then I saw there was this whole tube of live across the street.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Kids are sitting at the gutters and she's pregnant with another one.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They're gonna have another whichass protein the mother But does she even have a man?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I guess she must. Does she have a What a man she has!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Some of these chamber early, and they were banging their their soccer ball up against her.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Below the bedroom. The study went. you mind moving right from there?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Thank you I felt such an old lady there's 2 no there's there's 2 young ones in one who's like 12 who has friends.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The cow, the older cow and then there's the middle cow, and there's a little young cat the butterball.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They used to have this little butterball right when we first moved down here.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But to be running around in the street with his diapers on.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And then, by the time me once the top 20 so fat and he's, you know, a year and a half years years old.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But you yourself, you're and a half old here's the happier school.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They're 10 I can't how do you she just looks pregnant.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
She's totally pregnant it's not eating too much she's pregnant.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So I guess. I mean this just happens or we're in a baby's crying it's not worse than her screaming at. Never know.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah. False? Yeah. right? probably like shut up you. I feel as far as any subject, because they have no respect.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Most. you top masks Where? Yep, I guess the ones the lower women.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Is that what they look so different? Oh, I mean it where you see their eyeballs like was in addition to a mustache and beer.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But the thing is the second one looks like the guy who was in one of the little over skins who was like the second one from the top, looks like a guy who was in the Obama skate What's in over over the Brazilian troops.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
That was here dancing, and it looks like a real actual person doing this kind of thing.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
No, just like, you know. I mean, that looks kind of like a black person with red eyes and everything.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So. Where is this? From Susan? From Africa? Is it?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000
No, but that present looks fine. we're going to do in the need which one, Huh!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I look at anything. Yeah, that looks like a brother that's interesting, because I think I know nations or people who have been to Indonesia think that those guys like the 2 top ones have really European characteristics compared to donations

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
just as their eyes are realizes are big Oh, really, asians have real thin ice and flat noses, and stuff.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It goes well, the bottom that's what they all have no they all have big noses, but they get bigger as you go up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:54.000
What do you think, Mason? look African there mustaches visit the little hearing goes?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Oh, no, that's not even relevant I just glanced at that, and I literally saw this guy's face. and Obama.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:15.000
He looks like that guy. poor Guy Boulding Eye, because I remember he came to buy he after one of the shows when I stomach footing.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Well the top that's a real fit we don't know this black liver, Jackie, and this black one through Hood.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And a friend of mine. Yeah, she didn't want to dance with him anymore. Why, he just wanted to get close to me.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I can't blame him, but i'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:54.000
They travel all over the world i'm sure a lot of women build themselves So that's what they expect from women groupies fringe benefits big.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The only fringe bit of being a dancer fallen.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Hmm! I didn't know this but currently in brazil They have a very, very high ease affection really is supposed to be very high.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's something like 40% of males in the bay area or last July.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This is what she Doesn't seem that can be true But she said that 90% again for Hiv positive and 50%, all males great.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Tell me about that. Yeah, it was like half or worth a half of and it was fairly young then, but it had been exposed to Hiv virus.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It wasn't necessarily that they were infected Well, if you had Hiv positive it's the same difference, since they feel that sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease. But that's what she said now I

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
don't know if she met the bay area of San Francisco, but those are some ferocious numbers of what?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Not a 2 guys you meet because there are a lot of women out there who apparently don't believe in using condoms.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I'm just amazed Yeah, I heard absolutely mainly urban areas that had this really disproportionately high report percentage.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And then, like a rural area, that sort of like the Central Iowa and stuff had like 10% or less of the name.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Well, I would as soon as hampshire was higher than most cities that just move me away, because i'm thinking, well, gee!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
If half all the men or each i'd be positive what does that mean about the women are having sex with it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But and just hopping with guys, their twentys I mean these guys say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is what guys have been telling me you know and i'm thinking I can't believe that because in this city with all their information, it is just amazing. but people in their companies apparently aren't so I guess it's time for me to become

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
a priest it's too dangerous I don't know I couldn't believe it.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This woman. I knew I was gonna ask out you have to be Catholic, her sister, the Hiv counselor.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Let's check me, Harvard says you just want to use your owners and all i'm thinking equipment thinking how about you.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now, don't I mean what are they thinking so what would be I was just really amazed to hear that we're in the twentys, because I figured growing up around here you would know better and in high school, you know they

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:02.000
teach about it something. I thought we got our electricity fixed.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I thought I turned this off so that's really doing Oh, That's what you did just really say right what what is this?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I don't know it's from the radio station. years ago? when I was in Santa Cruz, you know, on Sundays at 10 o'clock.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That's right. a what is it key I don't know at the radio station.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
If I saw something they have Brazilian jazz out.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Is there a kksf I don't know what it would. but it was like I went by here last night after 8 left the 10 dropped this person off at home Fox City came back and haven't just noticing the Songs

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
airplane on the radio, or the exact same song as they were seeing it by any of the blind band.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
There. Hmm. should turn on the radiance you don't always sit with them.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes, sir, Does that mean any of you? Nope. You translated as in a Romal class.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It was just whatever station it was on, but I would just remember being surprised because I didn't realize I don't know anything about Brazilian music.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You go to the Brazilian club they're singing sounds prayer that gives us a popular stuff.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I guess i'm so used to hearing those songs because I burned for past 3 months. I didn't think anything of it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
But then this guy played sounds for a whole hour. and it was like 80% of those songs that banned the son of that very night.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I think that band's pretty good there Well, they have a different band.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It was an even Brazil. Oh, I went on that Friday night, so maybe it was difficult.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But when did you do that? The dance force, too small in that place?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000
That was really annoying. Are they teaching any more, Lombarda?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000
That school. Yeah, because well, my lumber is definitely getting better.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Really, I want to go out one bottle dancing with you and then i'm gonna start dancing with those Brazilian women, so I can learn how to beat my hips. I mean because their hips are beating up against

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
you, you know, like that bads 100 cycles per second, or something.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I mean I am not kidding. It is a different sensation entirely.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You dancing with them, and an only way to learn how I was advanced with them more.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But I feel like I can start dancing with it but yeah, I don't. They haven't done anything recently. I can't remember, because like so Swain shot that last for 2 months. me and June and is she a good

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Lombardic dancer I can't imagine her being Yeah, but I didn't feel like she taught it any different sniffling differently than what it would be in the jaxotic I mean because they are different than Brazilian to do

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
it. I mean? I don't go What those Brazilian women are doing.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:08.000
What are they doing? I mean first you had this wide sway of their hips this way, and then it's like they're coming. I mean they're beating me like this I don't even know how you can do that

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
you're dancing with them. they're beating you just like this, using their hands like that.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:30.000
No using their pelvic bones right but I tell you but anyway, you know they've aren't teaching it that way, you know, and people don't do it really. But that's what they teach then the teacher go 1 2.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
3. Where do they go like really fast like that? Well, sue swing, I mean, which sees it was different, more.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So they do the same thing. We have yeah sure but it's for people who can't move their hips. right?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I mean it's for basic yeah this is the beginning when bought a class or intermediate.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I don't know why they did it that way I mean It seemed to me a very human.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Might as well teach it what they teaching what happened socially could do 2 different things, you know right, Brazilians definitely.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Don't do it like I I should I want to go I should check it out.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I like it because it's fun. May have that I mean actually they still teach above you on Sunday.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Oh, yeah, In fact, I would have gone today and went from my back.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I finally found some people that I can dance. But for that bill, do you need a partner to go there?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah, Besides, you I mean if you're a guy if you're a woman, I mean those guys at the o movie.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:50.000
You don't necessarily mean in a bad way even though i'm sure there are a few there. i'm not dancing in the garage. All I can say is the women are all over me but I remember like I went there with

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
this person. it's kind of funny that this person did not want to dance.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Just use a small wire, so everyone's Why, I get a dance, and this line, when I come back.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I mean there was some guy there sitting in my chair every time I got up.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I'm thinking, Bob, he hasn't always any time I mean you turn your back and let somebody move it in. Oh, maybe didn't you come with me Why, so I can find I was I wanted to talk about it by some girls but that'd be cherry thanks to

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:36.000
them, maybe I should go. Okay, Yeah, you guys duty partners well, I don't know if i'd tell you that straight about that woman who went after that guy there.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I told you this story right? How is our Sunday peak?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:49.000
4 weeks ago, after the class is over with from sit down a table there's a woman who's in a class and 2 men sitting to my right is a table which 2 women there.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:59.000
They had apparently just come from Obama last night the last night, and i'm like well, I would track a little of the one hand, a real room, sharp spirit.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Anyway, there was this guy in his fiftys out there dancing himself, and was just looking to make an eye that she went out there, got on her knees in front of him in this scourge. This is sure.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Takes her hands, goes along his toes and up, and is just doing like that.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I figured oh, each other oh, very well, that's What I assumed, and they did that for the whole dance. and I mean she was all kind of suggestive stuff and touching them.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Everything people would like cheering and clapping. Oh, board and all this kind of thing!

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:46.000
The song ended, the got to sit down at another table and she sit down, and with her woman friend they never dancing in a recipe.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000
It's like. So I was thinking. this woman sitting about a 4 away from me is 2 years, and I was saying who this is interesting.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I wonder how long it's gonna take the guys in a club to move in on her?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
No sooner did I think this thought Guys were over at what you didn't ask her to dance.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I was still kind of figure out. Surely they must know each other.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I mean. Why, anyway, this guy I mean he comes over there immediately afterwards.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
The same guy who got his say. That number is no a random guy who was like sitting about where you are.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Yeah, he was sitting there. There were 2 guys sitting in a table right where you are.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And then these 2 women are sitting here so he comes over there and it's talking with that woman I don't know about what.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:41.000
But then, like him and his later, she and her friend over at their table, and then, 20 min later, they're kind of like all over each other, kissing, etc. etc.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And I was thinking it looks like these people i'm going home alone to me, but not just allowing that they forbidden so well, maybe I shouldn't go there.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
It was interesting. No, I was there before. It was fine. It was really like there before.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I went out there before, not even to I remember a few months ago I used to drive dancing every now.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Well, the thing that gives me I mean the users myself.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:34.000
I meet the psychotherapist to tell us machines addicted to this Danish or diamonds in the interests of world's philosophical therapist.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
You but she's married and apparently she's there without a girl's mother.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
She has a waiting ring on and it's like she's with this guy they're kind of like all over each other.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I'm thinking, Well, I guess that's your husband but I was thinking, the thing is, you know she's kind of sophisticating everything.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
I'm thinking, you know this guy I can't really believe that guys or husbands.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I don't know what's going on here and of course, later on I find that does not her husband.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:17.000
So i'm thinking I don't know what's going on here Bizarre concept.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But then she tells me she I don't know what it is about this guy.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Me been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him, and i'm thinking from the way they live.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:53.000
What i've seen in 3 weeks before. I look to me like they have to other people, I mean, maybe that was actually very profound.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Yeah, right. I really was wondering what that gavest thing, and he must have been, says he didn't know her.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
That was being quite a shock. I mean you 50 year old guy, and some 20 year old woman comes up doing that to you.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
What do you think you think you better go back to your table fast?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Apparently. i'll tell you when i'm 50 what you think? okay? Well, that'd be weird.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Wonder what you look like, if you don't worry about it Okay? Oh, well, 10 o'clock look like it's been time for some folks here.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Yeah, actually it's pretty much bedtime for me Yeah, well, that was good ice for me.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:20.000
What can I ask for him? Was that Buds pranins and crickets?
