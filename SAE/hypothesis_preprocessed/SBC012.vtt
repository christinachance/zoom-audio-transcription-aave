00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
all right. What else? politics deals with a question of power right That's the introduction to empowerment?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What is power very quickly. Come on, or you should know these 2 concepts.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They're not that difficult? what is power where we're talking about having the capacity to impact public policy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
All right. So we're talking about politics politics is tied to the whole concept of power, right?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we're talking about empowerment as a concept We must have an understanding of the notion of what is power.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now does power come? In what form does it come? in many different forms, different forms?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:01.000
By care what forms to be examples of power, either one of them Education, all right, knowledge. Okay.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What else? , your position in your workforce? All right.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well numbers of people. What else? social status? social status position, right? If you're the chairperson of a major corporation, which you say that that person has some pump, all right, especially your Ibm General Motors or

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Chrysler Corporation is like some example some gender race can give you power. Gender race, right?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's deal with it all right gender rigs let's talk about race in terms of power.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If I made the statement which I did that there's no fear factor when it comes to the Chicano Latino community, there is much more of a fear factor in dealing with the African-american community am I not

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
dealing with a racial factor of power y because it's going to affect the decision.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You can process the policy after bit. Then it kind of passed.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
African Americans have more organized and have more meters I don't want you just because we have more leaders who've been known or more rugged by one. But you are recognizing all right.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I think that's a good point that isn't part of the fear fact, I mean, if one looks at what Jesse Jackson is doing.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
These are the who the major League baseball teams and all that football and all that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What's his underlying argument what's his criticism, if they're not sufficient numbers of what Well, he says minorities, he's smart these boxes about minorities. but he's going to talk about

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
actually emerge in the managerial process right now the material older managers, etc.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Right, all right. Have you heard of Latino say this, or with a cloud that a Joseph Jackson is September eleventh?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Hmm! we have and we're going to get into that in our discussion. all right.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So the whole notion of power is very important to understand, because here I am making some statements, all right, some generalities that some people would say are not true.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I mean, how can Dr. or say? the Latinos have no more real power, no fear factor.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
After all, they have 2 people that are Cabinet members.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They have supervisor here in los angeles they have city council people in Los Angeles, and yet he's saying that they have no power where power is relative as well.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Right it's relative it's relational power it's relational hockey.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You measure power. power is impossible to measure all right. In other words, you cannot break power apart into the various ingredients, and say a B C. D.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
These are the ingredients of power. We can make generalities position well.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
All these different things that i've talked about but power is difficult to measure, so that we must deal with a whole question of empowerment. I'm.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Also the perspective of potential power versus actual power. There is a difference.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:31.000
If I am, for example, the president of a major labor union or a major corporation, the position as president of that entity gives me so much power.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But yet, if I do not know how to utilize that entity in terms of its mobilization for a given objective like a labor union, if I have 14,000,000 people as members, and that don't show any manifestation of

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:04.000
power in my power. Well, it has to be measured by what you're trying to do what the objectives are example labor today is being challenged by perhaps one of the most serious pieces of not legislation, percent because it's not

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in the legislative formula. But a proposed North American Free Trade agreement that had passed by Congress is going to impact 3 economies, Canada, Us.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And Mexico. labor as a sector is going to be the most impacted.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:36.000
How is labor today mobilizing Its great power not just the Afl Cio, And it's 14,000,000 members, the United Auto Workers and many other labor organizations.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What are they doing to influence public policy, dividing off to combine how they embodied the wrong by a line with other.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The reforming coalitions among themselves are forming coalitions with who environmental groups right?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because environment, supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted especially along the border. All right.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So there's a lot of coalition building but can you say it's a story that labor is doing what they were infamous for going 3040 years ago.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Take it to the streets. Right good point they have, he said. They have lost power.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So your measurement of a loss of power is based on what what they can't fit to art.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But you don't see what you read about right today, that's one perception is the black community less powerful today in 1,993 than it was 1,968 where the poor people's

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
March in Washington, or 1,963 Again, I know.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
March to Washington, I. Washington. when Martin Luther King gave us famous speech.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I have a dream. There were 300,000 people that march in 1,963, which period of time, historically speaking, was a time where blacks were manifesting much more power Today 1,963 in 1,900 and

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:19.000
68. what? and then manifestly beginning to get more, when an incompetent bring to a beer compression 1,993 1,968 during those 3 periods when would you say

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
blacks demonstrated much more power. You know they have one power.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Why do you say that? Because they're more recognized those recognition give you power to some aspects here.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I think I think the problem with your question is a different sort of priority.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We were good. You have African Americans more institutionalized in our system health than they were in 6.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Stop right there today. They have how many congressmen 3 8 38 Congressional River?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I don't know how many of you have 1,963 I'm.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Not even sure, I guess, but I probably no more than 2 or 3.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
If they were lucky, all right, reduce it in 68.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
The flexible lot, more mobileized, much better mobilized.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:34.000
300,000 Marshall Washington as an example you probably couldn't. Get that today. You know what you got was the high point of the mobilization capability with 1,970 during the era of the

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Vietnam war 25,000 Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles, the national Chicago Moratorium.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Against the war No one has come, even close with the exception of the death of Javascript, or there were approximately 40,000 people to mobilize large numbers of people into some kind of effort, or movement, all right so

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:14.000
he's correct it. depends on the time depends on the circumstances and the form of power institutionalized powers different from the unconventional form that you just described. all right i'm trying to get at this potential

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:26.000
versus action. My argument sample it is, is that Chicanos, in 1,993 fast developing a high potential for power.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But there are a long way from actualizing the true power in other words, that we're still at the potential phase of our empowerment and out of the actual power phase.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:49.000
All right. anything else. i'm most 2 concepts all right let's get into discussion on board of participation, and these are kind of general comments.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I don't have time to give you a lot of statistics.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll give you some general trends some statistical information that will prove a point that will introduce a subject of political participation in the United States.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now in a democracy. participation of the citizenry is imperative.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It is absolutely imperial. If it's to be a democracy to have the people participate.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now, what am I trying to say? What am I trying to say?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It is imperative for the people to participate in the political process.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Another way of saying, What am I saying? We have to vote anyone.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But why is it important in a democracy for the people to participate?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Still the question, not the methods People don't vote so they only agree with the monarchy that has control on what's a monarchy?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:19.000
What Close was a royal type of family, right king not elected i'm editory, 7 and 7 all right.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But what am I doing? what's the essence of what I'm asking for?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Yes, far away by it's very nature democracy demands suffering. Third, you made a statement by the very nature of democracy.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What is a democracy? Democracy is ruled by the people all right.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
There are most corruptals, right? people rule another Greek word.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000
The Greeks word major contributors to this political process of development concepts.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:04.000
They're most collected people don't remember rule we tell the world that democracy what we practice is that correct is that what we tell the world?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Yes, what else do we say in selling our political system?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And so in our political system we make it someonymous.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So now by saying that we don't distinguish the form of economic system versus a political system, and that we put it in the same kind.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Democracy and capitalism are essentially the same. Are they the same?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:51.000
No, but here we do. and if we listen carefully and read carefully all these books on international relations, foreign relations, and so forth, what is it that we tell the world that America is the cradle of the democracy?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We are the cradle of democracy. we are the bastion of the free world, etc., etc., etc., and one, while Reagan was in power, We talked about the evil empire right

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000
categorizing Soviet Union and the so-called Communist Empire as an evil empire.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:24.000
All right. I say this because there is a tendency for some of us to believe, because we have been conditioned right. who conditions us to think the way we think what we said earlier.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:38.000
On my code through school schools right? schools media everything else I mean doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two-party system in this country.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Why is it that the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party, the Prohibitionist party, the American Independent party?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
All these parties that we have supposedly minority parties don't get the same kind of treatment as a Democratic and Republican parties.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They're not mainstream right we have a two-party system.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We are taught when the very beginning that there's only 2 parties That's a different subject.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But when the point i'm trying to make is that if we look into the realities of what we have as a political system, we tell the world in this country, democracy is very much alive, because we have a Congress we have a supreme

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:30.000
court, we have a presidency. we have a political system that is governed by certain principles and laws that emanate from what the Constitution, which is a living document.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The Constitution right? That is very much the document that protects conceptual and otherwise.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Our way of life, our democracy, and so forth. Well, if we remember our Chicago history, my point is, we get into a whole question of Chicago.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Political participation is that It's difficult for us as Chicago as we get into it to understand. why is it including ourselves?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Because a lot of chicago's don't even understand why we don't vote, Why don't we participate?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And they come up with all kinds of somewhat superficial analysis that much of our political behavior is a product of what was covered in this class under history and culture.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And what did I say? 2 major currents of history, 2 major currents of political culture, right?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And what is political culture? I'll get back to that concept but just general terms?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:41.000
What is political culture? What is political culture? All right I want you to put that concept down?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Because you're going to hear about it in the next few minutes.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000
It's very important that you understand that concept political culture. but I want thing I want to underline here is that we are products of a historical touristic process.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Mexico, sister Us history, We're products of what a cultural process.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:15.000
That's also Mexican and American whatever America means right so those 2 major ingredients have molded the rationale that I'm using in this class to explain why is it that we're still at the potential

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
phase of empowerment, and we still have a long ways to go before we realize that concept that I described called empowerment.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:41.000
But before we get into that substance of that is that I want to just briefly cover that, even though i'm saying that Chicago does not vote in great numbers, that we don't participate in many organizations in

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:54.000
great numbers. The fact is, as I mentioned earlier, and even though we tell the world, we are the speak of a white freedom, liberty, justice, and all these different things.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:04.000
By, and large, not lot of people participate politically across the board. I encourage you.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:20.000
African American don't care if you're asian America i'll create your latino, or whatever most Americans do not vote in great numbers, so it's a double whammy introducing the subject matter here Americans in

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
comparison to Great Britain in comparison to France in comparison to Germany in comparison to Italy.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:44.000
We don't vote in the numbers that they do all right I mean if we had more time, I could give you statistic after statistic Italy, for example, has a border turnout. i'm 90% of those are algebra at

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
will We're lucky We get 50% are we less democratic.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Are they more democratic? Why is it that Italy has a much larger higher order level of participation?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Germany or even Canada, 70%. The fact is, a democracy in this country is dying.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I want you to put that down because it's going to be important at least for my analysis.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I don't want you to agree or disagree at this point. Just write it down.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You have plenty of time one week to think about it.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:28.000
American democracy is dying. I want you to put that whole phrase in black and white.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000
American democracy is dying, and I want you to try to think of why, as we do to the discussion which come on participation, and we'll get back to that statement this week.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So for us as Chicago is a double jeopardy. That's another point.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I wanted to score because of a larger general population doesn't vote a great numbers when you're at the bottom of the political socioeconomic total pool you're at the bottom you're at the very bottom with

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:12.000
all the problems of poverty and all the social problems that work we've been talking about It's understandable why perhaps Chicago do not vote for participating great numbers.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Now the literature in political science, dealing with factors influence before she boy, are many.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:36.000
How many. So the culture aluminum verba 1,972 or so is one book that you can look at.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:49.000
There's a book by raven wolfener Stephen Ronstein ronstone i'm sorry who voted that's another book, and the literature goes on, and up all I want to do in terms of

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
just giving you some idea of what are the factors that influence people's participation in the political process of this country, and they're essentially 5.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You can probably develop more. But these are general categories.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Most of the literature of political science, and I think Mr.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Verba would agree with me on this. People tend to vote because they have a sense of doing.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
What does that mean? A sense of doing? They regard participation as important.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Now, why would you say that this is a factor that influences body?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Now this is a very somewhat optimistic value, Right? a sense of duty.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:42.000
What? Why would you say that people in this country have some people more because they have a sense of doing?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Why right? and then probably it sends mostly from your homes and your childhood, when you're told you're an American citizen, and it's your civic duty you know, towards other people, and you know getting the government going to vote

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
and put your 2 cents in because without you then you won't have government same.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So of jury, maybe 2 good point as we go through some of these these 5.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I want you to think of the agents of socialization, because I want you to think, if we get to the discussion on Chicago, how do those ages affect us?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Such kind. Number one sense of duty who is responsible for inculcating that sense of duty?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:46.000
One. The family's your primary. agent to the educational institutions. I mean from the time that you start getting garden to the time that you graduate from a university, it's constant, constant, but somewhat of a consistent

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:56.000
bombardment of values attitudes etc. reinforcing the nature of the political system and the virtues of participating in the political process.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So in essence, what i'm saying is you acquire this through the socialization process that we've discussed on it.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Yes, I think that it's more to see that this doesn't exist more than it does.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And That's Why, people don't vote it seems that I mean you talk to people. they have an attitude.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I can't make a difference that's why I don't go my responsibilities.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
That's why I hope there's not a sense of duty from the beginning.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Suppose they were getting it? Why do you suppose that has changed?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And this is a much of a recent phenomenon much more because you've had declining order participation levels since the 1,900 seventys. I'm.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Giving you the answer. What has been the problem contributing to what you just said?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Well I agree. I do like you, say but I think maybe one of the reasons could be.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000
They're not being represented they don't think they're being represented, seemingly direct results for them coming out of the representation.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000
The Government using control. You need a lot of people car that's underway.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
They wrote their pocket, but they both definitely their pocketbooks right, that's true.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:28.000
What would you add? Well, you say whatever extent is like they say there's not much toys between payment less. what's in the bush.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I don't think we have much trust trust question this is Why more corruption?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
What did you have in the Seventys now? let's talk about that? What did we have? new model in the beginning?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
William in the late Chicago Vietnam. Go ahead! Excellent!

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
What does Vietnam do? turn the youth, especially against the government policies?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The educated youth more so. Those were I think the people that we're going to be buying as they went on.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
They lost people in the system. they lost trade and their leaders on that score.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Would you see that most of you, without getting personal? Here are products in terms of birth.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Of the sixtys. all of you were born in the sixtys from the seventys right.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
So that means that most of your parents very much part of the year of this Sixtys right.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000
All right, would you say, go back to you that your parents were very much influenced by the Vietnam war one way or the other?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Yeah, which way photography total apathy Why, well, my mom told me that she just, I don't know.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:47.000
I think she just got burnt out. She got sick and tired of turning on the news and taking another cruck band or another another scandal breaking out.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
She knew friends that were dying. And did you know she had friends that were drafted?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Percent were dying. She didn't believe in the system she just didn't care anymore.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
There was just a lot of negatives that built up, and she just let it go. Ok, how about you?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000
How about your parents? that was adopted and started to make it very long?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:28.000
But he was in a military. Okay, I don't know if my Dad really folks got it.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I know we come from a lot of military men. so he kind of felt a sense of duty.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Was there a sense of betrayal? Who else wants to show something?
