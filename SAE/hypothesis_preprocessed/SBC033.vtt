00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But engine of this family is a little guilt Motor agree with you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I totally agree right. we're making with herself boy embedded in conceit.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Nothing going like giving yourself a survey they're in a wonderful caf.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yes, I totally agree with you. really got a people visible.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yes, check really with me. Yes, yeah way 3 we're all alone, living in Missouri line, though between guilt and responsibility, like feeling a responsibility towards people and feeling of guilt to make yourself do things. and I think that line is the fuzzy I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
think often the guilt. strings are tongue no I haven't been thinking, Yeah, I don't know this is very massive about family.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Don't know she's right for a certain extent what to a 1,000.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I qualified, even guilt, especially if you're jewish yeah, you guys feel a little bit guilty about the way you tweeted us.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Rob me no good night or 2 days. like who's from there's. Still, you built me, and in response I feel these straight facts to guilt.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's now a verb that's like what we said to you is yield.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You'll start building, reader, response to say mom you're Guilty? Yeah.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Putting a little coat of gold on top right let's kill me not guilty plane plane, that's it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Mom, yes, go and play and playing stephen bye it's correct separate responsibility.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Guilty. Well, if you have no feeling of responsibility No, they don't little bit like there can be somebody feel like you have a responsibility in a case when that is not necessarily so guilt, is not the issue of the issue is a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
denial of responsibility. No, no, no, you totally turn when I sit around.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There's an act in agent there who is making you feel responsible for something that you are not responsible for.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Objective phenomena must have been taken on my truck.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Could define responsibilities. Right? Okay. In most human relationships there are no defined written in monogamy is a good example.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Family situation like sit cleaning up after yourself, or doing things that you have clearly done, find as rules in this house is your responsibility.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Oh, excuse me that's it as you are our assume but never Christy.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And therefore, if it's a soup that not delineated, it does responsibility exist or not, it does.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Good, So right responsibility lost. half of us back can be either assumed athletic order.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
There seem to be 3 categories. there's no responsibility. There is responsibility, but it's inarticular or a tactic.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Okay, you Say, we're not talking that's guilty i'm sorry.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We're not talking about she says oh we're not talking about guilt.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We're talking about responsibility. and denial responsibility I said, No, we're talking about somebody who makes you feel responsible for something that is not necessary, I said.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
How do you know? Always want to respond Harsh statement.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Time with have any of my topic you've got to be nicer.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:21.000
He wasn't a mighty chocolate Yeah, you know that was Yeah, that was your point, right right. right.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It's like when my cloudy used to say you'll be sorry when i'm dead Exactly.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But do you think she has a responsibility to be good to me?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Apocalypse 7 days the implication is that she's not good.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I disagree with You were not in the that were like at the cost of what?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Concerning to argument May, which created a rift for Buzz Day.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Turning you with grandma. They sound up here minutes wreck.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000
My mother. I think there is a legacy, whatever that we want, Mom says.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I pounced on her, and all I did this right.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I had it, mom? do it I didn't see what happened 10 you get back to the disagreement there about the what we're doing that or the trusting Wall, do you think that's true.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was about the lady right. But I happen to we reminds me of all these old people in the supermarket who are standing there going.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Be sure that's 21 cents or 20 the lady specifically said to hold off with putting things on the wild.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
That was getting a certain type of family. There was so many objects going on.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The was not clear for a little few minutes. There was already rock in, and what was not broken, and I did not want the lady to get it confused and ring in items.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
More than once, and she specifically said not to put everything on the calendar, putting everything on the capital.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I act like a child i'm just throwing things on I was not. It was an order to how I was doing it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:55.000
One person's orders Another person's match especially if you'll find ventilated about something that did not require a breakdown, and I was quite a so I said to her a car that this language just makes me angry this

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:20.000
exaggerated language. What does this have to do monogamous a slip? He's like the biggest proprietor of that.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Sometimes I do with the mom around other people I tend to talk just like this little joke of things that's just thank you.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:42.000
God, that's how yeah that's just coming from hyper like I said 20 times to one another's length.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So says mom, years more rack than and it's years paragraph.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So there's a more history here. that's yeah you're the kind of chimpanzee what my worries say that being would have to ask my anything don't look at me in the tall voice or yeah it's true

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:48.000
no came back with each other right with things didn't mean started start with that way of speaking just like Mom like I don't feel like people said that Jews said that in the nineteenth century 6 West time.
