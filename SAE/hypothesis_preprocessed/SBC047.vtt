WEBVTT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, I tell you, man, that factories at Pittsman last night I got him to the hassle with James Boyd. I'm in the cafeteria, and they took a break.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That was just a little bit too long, and I gave him a half a hard break stretch a 15 min break into a half hour, and then he comes into the cafeteria, and I thought he was coming in to chase everybody.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Away, but he's coming after me and he calls me now fucking out the door right as he's walking in the other.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And he goes. George, I want to talk to you. Come here and go.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And you got to pack those in cases and so like I didn't put that done on my production.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:07.000
How many cases you packed I don't know man I packed 2 talents, you know I don't know how many cases that is, but you know that that shit was heavy man and like and like done on the cart.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You know no cases because it was lost. time, you know you know we we strip the signs and everything, and like we were teaming up with somebody. you're working alone. Oh, Gutierrez is doing the same. job. But we weren't Working alone.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah, and so he comes and says, well, he goes I don't know if you've if you've packed this or not, you know, on your production, Carl, it says you know that you did 3,000 sheets.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Per chili loads. Yeah, but you didn't pack it so go.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah, I go. look, man, there they are, you can see there's my name stamped right on. there.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I just didn't put it down. Oh, well i'll go to figure it on.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It was, What are you doing in the cafeteria so late? I'm just going.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Oh, man, this is the pits man this is that's what we wanted to hear.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yeah, really, this fucking my appetite you know getting on my case.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That's Nothing new. it's nothing always been like it's part for the course. man. right?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yeah, definitely. Well, I can't take that type of living anymore. even if this career doesn't work out for me i'll find something else that will something else. we're gonna do real estate.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Maybe definitely, I got my books and everything i'll be studying, and but in a sense I need some type of steady income.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But the competition man, is it real tough like on the lot Yeah, it is. There's definitely there's guys that have been doing that for 5 years, and they're real good at it that are real good at it and they know how to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
talk to the people, and they know that when somebody's coming in if they're buying or not.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Oh, they could tell right away. Yeah, but that all comes with time you know they're pretty helpful with me, and you know it all come in time.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I figure the more cards I get out the more people I talk to the more cars i'm going to sell.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It just all comes with time. Once I get my experience i'll be up there, too, and the top 4 salesman.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Your parents don't know yet. Huh! nurse don't know when I come back. I think my dad told me yesterday they're coming back to fifteenth through 16 definitely I think it's gonna be the fifteenth, which would

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000
be on a Saturday and i'll be working until 9 o'clock, so they'll be pretty happy for me more or less, because they didn't want me to work in the factory much longer Yeah, I know my mom doesn't know what to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
do to get me on, but they didn't take a trip through Brazil and Aren't.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They they spend the whole time in waking I think so they told my dad told me he was gonna go to Argentine in Peru and Columbia, but he only wrote one letter. and then they were in no one's called him I mean no one's talked

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to them, he said, Postcards everybody in a letter but yeah other than that he hasn't called or told us what's up and him being here, no time is he staying over at Manoa Paras Yeah.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Yeah. and the other architect is his nephew or something.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Pablo Graph Pablo, graph. yeah he's A architect. I never met him. I know my No, no, no, no, no tone of his brother's sons or something.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But they'll come back. they'll be happy to see me here, that I got a new career going, and they weren't all heartbroken about you know Cc.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.000
All that. Well, they have no idea what's happening right Now they have no idea they left were on shaky grounds, but you know they thought it might be able to work out so when they come in.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They'll be pretty shocked. Yeah, and and her but like I say things will work out for the best what about her folks.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They're not sorry at all. no in fact i've seen him I went to church with him for the last 3 Sundays.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Really season. She thought it might you know help our relationship as friends. and she's still considers you man.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Huh! Exactly. she does, because I mean we went to church together for the last 3 Sundays, and I went to the movies after, and her folks were at church, and you know afterwards her mom had an injury on her leg or something she

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:58.000
wasn't at church last Sunday we went to the to their house, and I went over there and her brother was there, her nephews and nieces, her sister, our godson, and you know it's just like everybody was real

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
friendly and everything. Yeah, I don't know if the parents are aware that we did, you know, separate.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But it possibly was for the better because they they didn't feel comfortable with us living together, anyhow.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yeah, right, that's not looked on too good huh so what they what they probably think is, you know, that we still have a lot of love for each other, that Mgly not was the best thing until we both are ready for marriage and if

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
she still loves me, and I still love her and we want to get married.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There's still the chance of us getting back together and getting married this time.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah. So I mean, I think things are working out pretty good.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
She called me the other day, and you know she calls me talks to me, and I call her and ask her our day wasn't anything.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What what is your sister? say when they tell me to stay away from her?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Don't even call her anything. Wait till she calls you and everything.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But you know that's not right yeah that's hard I mean if she accepts me calling, and she doesn't tell me don't call me or they're telling you that Why, too, like Because they feel that she's gonna

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
get too strong by me. you know kissing her ass or something, or crawling back and begging her you know for me to come back.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I'm gonna get the upper hand exactly which which you know she probably already does.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But i'm not gonna just wait for her to call me because it's not right.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I have feelings for her. I want to know you know how she's doing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'm gonna communicate with her that's all there is to it. it's not like i'm asking her, you know.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Let me move back in, or you know i'm sorry I just want to remain friends with her and find out how she's doing so.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They they tell him I don't tell him I call or nothing nice, and her flowers.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Last week I sent me flowers to work and the day before I moved down just to tell I was sorry about everything that had happened, and that I hope we could remain friends, and that God brings us back together if it was meant to be yeah, and

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
she's real happy about this, so that really meant a lot to me.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But you did send me flowers and and then, and what you wrote?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Yeah, exactly because she knew it came from my heart, no matter what I put her through and everything she knows deep down inside.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I really did love her. But I had a problem. You had to get something out of your system.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah, but I don't even know what it is in fact I might have to go to therapy or something to find out, because there's no there's no like this exactly backed out of it's okay, most men

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
do look at other women, and just go through their mind and everything but that i'm impulsive.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I'd act on my impulse yeah like i'd see something i'd want, and i'd go after where I I had a beautiful woman I shouldn't have thought like that at all Yeah, this is what a lady told

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
me that that was a therapist. She said she was going to get me somebody to go talk to, and everything she said.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Possibly was I was not satisfied with myself I wasn't happy with myself.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:04.000
For some reason, and that I just acted out yeah wow so I don't know it is a problem, because I I did have a nice whole lady in jail, and the master and everything it's lonely coming home after putting into

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
12 h a lot, and working all day and you know working all evening, and then you don't have anybody to come home.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Share it with Yeah, are you working 12 h you're gonna be you're gonna be doing that 9 9 9 9 9. Well, I'm, if I want that's all that's up to me basically you know they're gonna give us a

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
shift either 9 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon or 2 in the afternoon to 9 in the evening.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So if I wanted to come in before 2, if I was on the evening shift, I would come in at night and work 99.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I was on the evening shift from 2 to 9 I could come in at work from 9 to 9.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So can you apply it right,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They hired to right on the spot, right on the spot.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:00.000
He gave me interview. He talked to me, told me why I wanted to get into sales, and if I felt I could sell, if I had any experience and everything, and you told them about all the cars that you had told me I had done sold cars all

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
through my early years the private party you've had about like 30 cars, at least 30 cars.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So I have some type of experience selling deal. You know, my handling the money, and the only thing it is I have to work on is doing.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The paperwork is filling out a contract. and basically paperwork, which is very simple.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:34.000
That you know. Once it comes along with the experience and the more people, I work with the easier it will be that's the most important thing, and selling them the car talking to somebody in to buying a car that doesn't want to

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
buy that that's there. to look yeah but yeah wouldn't mind owning a new car that's right, and you've got to talk them into.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You got a cell tune, you know. you Got to get them in your office, and you got to sell that car to him.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You can't let him leave without that sound otherwise they're going to go elsewhere right if they believe you and you could sell them.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You're going to make this car you want this coffin to take it with you.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
What can I do for you in order for you to buy this car? I mean, if a price too much, I could work on the price.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Let me go Talk to my manager. Maybe I could drop it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
5, $600. Maybe we have a 300 rebate that you could use towards the down payment.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Maybe it's 3.9 financing that'll save you money in the long run.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
If you finance 15 or $16,000 so you know it's just it's like a game you know.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Yeah. So Holmes, they put you through training all these days.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah. 5 days I watched video plays dealing with the sky that that sold cars and made a 100,000.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
His goal was to make $100,000 every year selling cars, and he accomplished his goal.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Every year he sold $100,000, and he retired at 35, after certain amount of your selling, and he just got into making audio cassettes in sales to motivate motivations on a system to the cell exactly books

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
seminars. Yeah, video tapes 100,000 a year.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
That guy must a hustle. Well, it's possible you figure you could sell at least 20 cars a month every month for 12 months.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You know you're gonna be up there in 70,000 $80,000 bracket 20 cars in a month, that's almost a car a day exactly which isn't difficult if you're on the lot for dam 12 h and one car isn't all that much if

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
you have the clients coming in that's the only thing if you have the traffic.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We're on a busy street firestone boulevard right price somewhere by the 605 right exactly right before the 605 right right right passed down here. We used to play basketball on the

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I'm a mile going east you know i've been wanting to go visit you, But i'm afraid you're gonna sell me a car bro that's the last thing you need to do is get in any more debt than

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you already are, man. I got to get out of my debts. yeah, and then i'd be a free agent man.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
In fact, I was planning if they were gonna play basketball.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000

I don't remember I just got liability just liability which is good enough.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
At least it's not sure if anything happens to anybody else for sure.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:44.000
But you know I took care of the registration. I registered under my name and everything, and got my tags for 88.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Yeah, and got custom plates on how much it the tags cost you. 50.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
She's being cool. I put that I gave this car to day roles for gift, so I didn't have to pay any sales taxes.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Otherwise I would got stuck $300 just in sales tax alone, and I got custom plates on it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Say how hustling nobody else had that 36 bucks a year.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But that's a good one for that's what i'm doing now.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
That's my I got a hustle to make money if I don't hustle.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I'm not going to make burn yeah but everything's fell in a place pretty good, I mean.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Things happen for a reason. The situation that i'm in happened for a reason.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I changed my career. I took care of everything, I had to take out of the car, and now i'm gonna save my money and try to get my own path condominium, or whatever the case may be.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I'm gonna be saving a lot of money working here, So if I'm making decent money, i'll be able to get something on my own.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah, with the help of my parents, of course, because when you say it happens for a reason, it's like it happened to get you off off my ass.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Get me out of the factory. get me into a career that I can make good money, and to realize that I had a good woman, and I shouldn't I shouldn't want to have anybody else.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:29.000
She spent 12 years of her life with me and she's always been positive thinker, and always been good yeah understanding.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And sure it'd be different if she were a bit and all his name.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:42.000
He getting on your case, or didn't enjoy doing anything she always was, you know, exactly pretty much able to do anything that I wanted to do.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
She was never negative or anything. And it was basically me, you know, going out a problem going out.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
So it happened for a reason. Now I hope that you know in the future.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000
She realizes that I have changed and matured, and she would give me that chance, you know, to go back with her and try to make our life work together.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Yeah, but only time will tell. I got to prove it to her, and I got to leave her on her own.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Let her see. Yeah, even if she goes out with other men or dates other men.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:34.000
If that's if she does feel any attraction towards anybody else never know.
