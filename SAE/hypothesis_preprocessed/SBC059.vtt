00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The guy didn't even get up to the line of scrimmage that was had the ball. But he must have pushed it up there, or something.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't know how he got it up there but they gave it to them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And this and when was this they found out about it that they've been doing it?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But these young ones, they say that the one set won't let him back down.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now the new ones you know that just got in there because they They've been taught that probably you don't break down.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The steers looked like a much better team, I have to admit, because they went right down there every time they hit the ball.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
beginning, like if you took first, or second, or third or fourth semester of the language, then you probably will have a Ta.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
If you take more advanced like literature courses in a foreign language, then you have a real professor.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Do they pay them very good. they didn't pay you very good.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
When well, that was a public school. Yeah, I know. But even so, there was some people.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I never asked them for teaching degrees, but like at marquette if you're a ta you get free tuition, and if you're a ta it means you're going for your graduate studies oh, so they if you get free

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:51.000
He just put $8 or $9 He isn't allowed to have the checkpoint at home. he's really good at me. Now the budget is good, so that's what he's I think what he's teaching you know

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:02.000
how that you would go about making up. budgets for big organizations. I know a lot of people just don't keep track that well of their own checking account.

After I got home from warm, we're out there talking askers of come out with up shelters.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I'll buy one, We're getting up to jolters this end of the bar, and there was a guy on the other end of the bar really loud, you know.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So Oscar goes down there, and I was coming back from the Jan, and Oscar went down to talk to the guy.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.000
He says, Hey, listen! Your son of a bitch I brought my friends in here to talk, and I don't want your loud mouth overdoing what we're talking about.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Way down there did the guy shut up? He was either a mean old, so he was.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
He was built like, I guess, like Marv is now. But he was real.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Yeah, you know. Well, you know he wouldn't go to the dentist.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.000
He pulled his own. He goes out in the garage or in the barn, and no in the garage, you know.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
See it a smick, Brad, you go out there even now?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
He got up there and he whole thing out, and it never made him say, can you believe that?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I mean copper, 10 bucks. When I was a kid my parents used to pull my teeth.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.000
You can pull them yourself with a finger. yeah they're easy, but not ones that, you know.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
All the kids pulled around, too. I always pull my own team.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Yeah, cause you want the dollar. Oh, I don't think it was a dollar to start with.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Well, when you start it, hey? it's bring around your tooth and close the door to pull the tooth.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I think so. Oh, wife, tail! me your chair's a little squeaky!

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:24.000
