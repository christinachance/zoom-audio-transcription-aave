WEBVTT

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like? Was he a virtually new i'm not because he ever had a girl where he didn't have to pay her?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He got like I told you about the time he got like a blow job at the light front.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
No, you Didn't oh, no way all the head was I was just me, and meanwhile me back up here I started hanging out with your name.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Gina got smashed and we like met Oh, cool. How she knew.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay, I would say a half 1,000,000,000 years, but anyways. we're like making out and stuff like farm. So that's what we were regularly well, not because we did.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It was like 2, 3, 10, or something like that so after victors.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:11.000
After Tom had 2 women fighting over who he's in the homeland, he went home with this one other girl a heavy set girl and me and Jeanne and all of us were walking down the hill.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They don't going down where it the pier is except we're one of the big hill, and it's like a major name.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We're used to walking down that steep grassy part, and it was so. we heard it up with the grassy part by the tense court. It was real dark and you couldn't see us at all after we've

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
gotten to the level plane, so we like heard up to this one spot we always went to.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We sat and looked around in town, and were yelling and screaming for us, and they started to make an analog of 100 yards away from.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But there's trees that are standing in front of a tree so you couldn't see that we were sitting by a tree, so you can see us so they're making out and we're sitting there talking and stuff a joke and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:06.000
he's like all of a sudden we hear analysis the dam is no isn't it very distinctive noise, so i'm like I know they're not due. I think they do they were looking around the corner I couldn't see

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
anybody. and then I saw Tama took a step back or something.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I could see Tom, or something on this side of the tree.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Then I saw head or movement lower than what I saw Tom.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So then the picture became clear at it he's getting ahead from this chick.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
He didn't even know, and it was kind of cool so I don't know.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So did he do it, or did he just get the blow job just to blow jokes like it was getting like you should have worked in the morning.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But that's the first chick I ever saw i'm with here in the United States.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Otherwise he's only paid for it do you pay for it back homework. Yeah, it's 50 bucks for hookers still kind of big price.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
These here. you have to like, paid 50 bucks go to dinner and movie.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We have to be real nice, and then we just may be something might happen if she likes you.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If the wind falling in the right direction, no one tripped over anything earlier.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Well take 50 bucks. go get a hooker and go out let's see your friends, and have some fun.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Oh, your Co. is going on to that one strip in Chicago.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
What's true, the one over by krobar it's like by the bridge.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.000
street, and was like, Well, hey, zeus, it's like you need a girlfriend.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
She's really weird, too. it's kind of cool so anyway, that and then

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I'll never forget the one time Rob and I went out to Chicago.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
That was like probably like 3 or 4 in the afternoon we're like let's take a drive around the city.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
You know. Just first I made drives we were driving around the city also, and we see the classic hooker.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:39.000
She's got the fishnut stockings on Obviously she's like a $5 hooker trying to get her her afternoon fix so that she can go get drugs. She's got her skirt.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:54.000

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Did it pull over to the road? Well, I look her I thought I saw.

Yeah, I remember that I was like, Oh, come on guys i'm not a coach.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Oh, yeah. But now the Scripture was kind of interesting.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We were putting near Karma we're looking for plug out.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We saw this hooker across the street. kind of leaving us over and I'm looking at it, and everyone's like saying, Yeah, pull over pool or pull over and I'm like Ok this is kind of cool So i'm

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
thinking, Okay, just for Joe, we should pull over or say something.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But then I looked over to the right and there's this white Van clean white man in warehouse district, you know, sitting there across the street from this hooker and i'm like no i'm not going to be on

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.000
That's all that we see this one that whole feels like you Know where you go when you turn off the freeway by a boxbuster.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You turn love. Do you mean you're going straight and you go over that bridge just before you hit the bridge and on the bridge until you get to that street that you turn on Crow Arts online with a curse in the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Otherwise they there's like the whole strip is just the classic type of your mother.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I'll sure you know that and once it was kind of funny because it was like all these cops are like they're like driving.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000
They don't do any some of them. they just keep driving or the they'll stop. and they'll talk to the girls, or whatever incentive Milwaukee.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Oh, yeah, I love that cares nothing. so yeah you're too silver for me. Well, do you want to grab me a beer, please, much out of the Lasagna?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Did you eat a phone I must truly i'm sorry cause she's supposed to say, Do we get heat out?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You want to get more cheese that's how it's going.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I have I keeps, too. No, too bad we don't have a lot of money trees, or put one's lock here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Here, hey? Don't knock on i'm not I don't know.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Did you want to do something like that? Yeah, let me just kind of wait up and live it up over and put on some clothes?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, you don't have to put any but it's like you know it's like I have to also watch Melbourne's colleagues this show that in like 4 years for I've avoided watching

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that show board year. I don't care it's my favorite show, and tonight Billy finds out about his little bitch wife lied to him.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:10:04.000
She told him that she was pregnant when she exhibited all the classic sciences shit, and they told everyone. Well, it was turned out that she just wanted it so bad that that she had signs that she was pregnant

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and so now She's like he's got a divorce or I think, thank God, name because he belongs to Billy I mean Ellison.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Anyway, he didn't tell me that the massachusetts was right on the top of the beard my hand like 5 or 2 paper.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tell. I know I wiped off my jacket, and my dog is going to risk my code.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Why is my hands so tender today? I don't know you should have to come up from earth?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Help shit one of these days i'll have a really fun drunk in New York.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well, maybe next year, because i'll be there's no way I work in another our business by at the time because I'm not working another book in 3 years.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I don't mind going in chicago yeah that's what I want to do that's going to be my guess.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Plan all so far i've talked to everyone everyone said yeah, but who knows?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
The money might not be there. we're planning to go to New York in 1999 to 2,000.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We're going to be new excellent you're welcome at home.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I thought so. but hopefully, I won't be with mentally by then, and social life is going down here a lot all my social life.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's natural going downhill because everyone I know is getting around sucks.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Football. Everyone can hold a little getting along everyone's got girlfriends they care about.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I know It's like I don't even hear from Greg anymore.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:05.000
What's up with that he kathy's going to be gone for 2 weeks, so all of a sudden he is like he's going to spring back into our lives.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Hope he other, since he heard that as having problems with my band you know it's been calm a lot more we've been hanging out the stuff.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I just really that's what pisses me off because like the same thing is going on with with release.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You know, is it was like also well here we did all this stuff, and for about a month now she's had a boyfriend, and I call her she's never home.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I got a hold of her yesterday. I actually we even try to color our new She wasn't there before, and no that's like i'm like.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Well are you you know like one that's in your wild and then she's going on time, florida for like school starts.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Now on the third. So you know I remember the story to it also because it's one thing like for meeting you to hang out and stuff like that pictures Whatever I we're totally different social levels. I mean It's easier for women.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:33.000
To walk into a bar not know anyone and then come on knowing everybody it's hard for a guy to because he comes off like a big, huge pervert, so i'd have to be chasing your own crap in your style it's just cool that all girls

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
go in Ogl Eyes boat and if you're too social whatever. at the same bouncer on no everybody level.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It's cool because I don't want to sit here and drag you down stuff in Germany. man displeased by the permissiveness of the 70 s would be done to fear you remember this story.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000
This guy the true story he took took him over 20 years to catch this guy.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
He might be shot in his entire family, and then disappear.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So what issues? family? Because he was afraid that their morality was going downhill?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Well. So he shot his mother, his kids, and his wife on his daughter.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The this matter all in the milk, and Colin was like canceling delivery. 45, A.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:28.000
M children that left the school state hours they're really executed. I I don't think it's all sick and twisted, You know, the last time i've seen the singer is like less than what you know i've

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:52.000
heard the pictures, and also I saw showgirls was on or on videotape, though, and cool.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Don't ever look at you it was the last time I did anything with Great bill.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:25.000
First one. Oh, and you know I also have this but since he canceled all the stuff, and like he pulled he said, It's like I know i'm pulling my kids out school.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm taking them up upper vacation shit and all this met.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
So no is expected that the family was dead a month or 2 months.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So they're like laying there in the house and all of a sudden it's like started stinking, and someone walked in the house, and falling all their decomposed bodies, and he by this time he had disappeared

00:16:45.000 --> 00:17:03.000
John, despite his fear of imminent bankruptcy let's, collected $2,100 for the sale of, and he wrote notes to the children's teachers lighting their absence all of what's left just a

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:21.000
pack of view belongings disappeared. cool. Find out how a sculptor helped plus his killer. final.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Just, and after 20 years they could let the guy go. You killed his old fucking family, though.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yeah, that was 20 years ago, he didn't do it since at least they're no moral.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:52.000
What, thank't, believe your rationale I would never you know seriously.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Think about walking up. The parents been doing. pulling the trigger by watching your brain splatter all over in a nice white, I mean over the wall.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000
No, It's okay. Just one of the scary a little bit Did you catch a little reference to White or White Walls City?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I wish I was at Metropolis yesterday. I think it cool.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I think Greg with me would be a little bit more emitted.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
The deployment, you know there's no food nothing Oh, we didn't have food, either.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Let's videos are going downhill now. we used to I think I like her before, with all their chubby stuff.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Now I don't like a bone I think she's ugly, you know.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Still over here, but I like like super skinny daily rib poking me in.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I like it when you give it poke a female.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000
She jiggles for like 2 s afterwards, I like that like i'm healthy.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I like it. We could sit down robust yeah then I don't understand why you like Rita, because she's got like awesome eyes.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
She's like a she's like a what is skeleton mouth.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I agree. I was just getting this eyes. Oh, yeah, I like her, but I never.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I could never date her there's. a difference for me I like a lot of people like, for instance, your phone. Well, that yeah, I could date her to do accidentally.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Tell her what I told you to tell him. Yeah, what did she say? Well, actually, she was interested in that guy at the country kitchen.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I know, because my heart fail. Sorry also. just now do you see why I didn't go, but turned out he didn't even show up.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I guess. good You could tell her I said that too, and it's got me on tapes, damn it was white in the for each other.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:38.000
They were all lined next for one another after by the time the bodies were discovered listed already That I will run for 30 days 63. Chevy Apollo was discovered at Kennedy International Airport of his

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
identification was in the car. Some, like the car, has been planned.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:21:10.000
