WEBVTT

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
No? Well, before I go well you know they're really concerned about these proposals on the ballot for next week.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Her 2. it's nice to be able mom I really have to go through and read this to make sure that I didn't leave out any of my sentences or anything.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We need to make progress, not go back over what you've already. done.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, because out of the 8 that i've done I noticed on one of them I skipped 2 sentences.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
They weren't really important. but I did skip 2 of them and so now i'm paranoid that i'm going to skip a bunch more.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I have to go back, and for free does it matter?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Not At this point you should be making progress. Okay, Your 10 min are up, and I proof read the whole thing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:08.000
How many pages do you disagree just 2 more actually okay. I'm gonna check on you in 10 min. if you haven't gotten one page done in 10 min.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
One side of a page. It takes me a long time because I've got to go over the sentences figure out if I'm going to rewrite them or leave them the same, and just write them out I can't write them exactly

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the way they are because they stink i'm fine i'm not gonna do any better downstairs.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's not really the algebra to do it can skip algebra.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
No you know all right, fine i'll do my you'll also see them.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So what So through? She knows it too. She do it on purpose.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Take it downstairs, or are you going to add like the little lines that jet out of the you come back from that?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Yeah, it's erasing and i'm not marking on it I don't care if it's iris Well, don't touch it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I didn't I know that's actually a very good letter to sir.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I know this is your final mom. You gave me another 10 min.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Okay, I retract all my art arguing. I totally agree.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I should go downstairs Now can I stand here doesn't work in this household.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You may use my desk what we meant to royal masses.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes, it is. You always have to carefully set things aside soon i'll go through the files. no you guys.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I want to be able to be with you it's a large Peru last night.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I don't think so hard. Well, I know that it might just be fun to listen to them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
One thing is, never bring up politics to find graham hutch because you'll get in a big family arguing with his mom or no.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Was it, grandpa? Well, anyway, even a way it's not pleasant to talk about it with either one of them either way.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I made some comment. I made some stupid comment like, Why are you voting for them, or something like that?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And then they went on for like an hour, or the whole dinner time, which was probably 45 min about political views and all this other stuff, and they just talked about it on and on, and on and on. and so Mom, told me never ever to

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
answer anything about that again. That was Grandpa I asked him something about the Democratic platform like, What do they believe? Question. It's not pleasant to talk about politics.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If anyone who doesn't believe I did not believe but doesn't agree with you, vote in the same way that you've loved it, or whatever I don't hardly ever play a real way it's just like tonight.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
That it's service. noble whatever name is the sitting on this side.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
She says some dog, Clem, and you know I figure what she said, you know.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But supporting Clinton. Then I was just kind of some about that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And here I know she says Well, I don't know she says I'm going to vote for the other guy, and a conversation.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Let's just be quiet folks, Mrs. noble is definitely very democratic mom.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I am going because she's pro-choice anyway.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I think that's not a good reason to face your decision good.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I can get one of our great erasers and just go.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Why is there an exclamation point there isn't one anymore? which being raised, It's not symphony. it's symphony like that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What are you gonna do with this thing? drawing there's erasers?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We got to go. Someone wasn't using their tickets and gave third chin. Kills create violinist who makes his living.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Really good understatement does pretty make them better concert, and the city does pretty good for being a little one.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
More southwest of Michigan, something and vodenoy the conductor's been here now.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's gone, the coma zoo so to me some time what's the symphony called her?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well, they call it easily Twin Cities. I think they call Southwestern Michigan Central.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
They do because they draw a lot of people from not using teachers from Kalamazoo who plays it?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You mean? Yeah, I remember hearing some guys complain a year ago, only first moved here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They call it Twin Cities, where they let all these people come in and take over all the first chairs and all the other.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So they changed it. don't put that on the floor tracing to waste it.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.000
They did, for instance, now, and we got the metal center out here.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Everyone who plays in it. They don't get saved much people, but they do belong to the musicians here.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Yet, and it's not really high it'll be off no no, it's, I think, for I know somebody who makes a living is, I think it's so much an hour for performances I don't think thing to get paid for

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
all that rehearsal time my cello teacher I didn't like you cello.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:52.000
But see, he's a teacher, though, you meet the English Saturdays in here, and and he plays and I'm pretty sure he made it just become a new orchestra.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Does he teach? Just hello! What that did you teach just cello you can't keep my own history and make if you teach, and you have a lot of school.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Be good at really really good, I think. And what you start getting the clientele. Yeah, it sounds like this is strictly, you know, like on school here, strictly weekend.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Of course it comes down here in a week, and I suppose he has afternoon, evening, or whatever students tons.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Every day he goes different places. he's in kalamazoo, but like if he comes here, maybe he goes someplace else, so he could get my slave even go to battle free.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Gone afternoon. better school. This seems like a pretty nice guy, though.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Does he teach in a school system, too? he's strictly He's not married, or anything I think strictly private lessons and orchestra just totally chow I thought maybe a music teacher too, who did you tell me he

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:25.000
was easy to be asking. somebody person can do it hate it I've got to start working on like to I won't get them all done Friday afternoon, especially, and staffing around this cool shit know him gets in a often tomorrow. night.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000

Or a ribbon or what I think is I don't even know what to wear It's just I think i'll wear my white dress with the black diamonds. it's okay, with me not to be that critical but it eat that awfully

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:35.000
10 all right forget it. it's a small show it's not regular size 7, 30 high school, but there's even a guess.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Oh, Joyce, do I have to go Well, he also has club Well, that's right.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You got your club lives. Think he should have to come I had to go to a sacrifice? it's terribly lopsided.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I need to do something better, and for that right now I have to draw a stupid figure that's a problem.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I didn't want to do anything jaw stupid person has to be 12 inches tall at least.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You could draw yo your ma. Do you know what he looks like?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:30.000
What am I gonna do? Just guys sing there and then have his eyes go yo yo ma Chinese I guess at the moment, if you like the yo yo it's a normal American name could have been swedish Anyway, he's

00:10:43.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Here is my streamage. This is my only straight edge see Let's say that's approximately approximate Italy.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The approximation of the stock rate did go through the middle of your drawing, and I don't feel like measuring shielding.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Doesn't look right off center. Huh! You have to draw yourself 12 inches high, with a cho with the cello in your hand, tells you anything for that.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You practically do that with a quarter-sized violin, fit it in your hand.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The bob came by this afternoon. call them and tell them i'm not quite finished with it.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Course That's I think it's the end of that excuse dear? the time has changed when we awaked.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Is that a word awaken you can tell there's grammar is? well, it says it says I bet it was fun for him when he awaked at the and like that when he awoke if you ever mentioned yourself dead just to see what people would think

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
either a heart attack or an aneurysm. They suspected me.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:27.000
It was a strange clerk. I guess Mom said it was a cerebral hemorrhage, which is an aneurysm, but I suppose they're the same.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Yeah, they are, since i'm not a doctor but mom said that's what it was, and they weren't going to do about useful proofs.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It had to be one or 2 i'll clare to sit at school at school.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You can color. i'm just gonna make the line here please i'll do something which sounds better.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I bet it was fun for him when he awoke, or I bet it was fun for him when he awakened me.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Try away him. i'll say awakened because that's what I have written out.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Just watch you put it. No, but no way. I really like it.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Me alone, and you could say, my father, I would have put a weight.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:47.000
But really I think everyone in this family should read this book, but I really it would be.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
You would enjoy it. Yes, i'm sure gee aren't we that nice word today.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Yes, we are, little cheerful boy, thank you well starting in November.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
We're going to be looking at the sky have a day by day.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000
November calendar of where to look and what to look for as in planets, it's pretty neat looking. Do you have a telescope?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Well, now, I just think it. I stuff he has a telescope, though.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Well, no, no easier to do. naked. all applies 40 times, or binoculars.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
It does pretty good when you Can find the moon Well, it's just not a hole you find that our binoculars would be just let's go.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
We did this thing about. We were talking about how in science books.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And you see the solar system, How is so out of scale?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And it cannot get a scale for distance. The same time get objects that can give you the scale for the size of your planet. But we're trying to do a scale for they have this thing going on for a scale.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
For distance. So we started at one end of the hallway with a roller.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
What people don't have so many sheets of toilet paper?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Do you roll out? And so you go so many! And we were way down the hall like 483, you know, for Jupiter Jupiter, How far are you to do that distance like how wide it is Diameter?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
83 like 4 and a half inch squares.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But where were you in hall? What in your school? Well, it was a fair playing bus school.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Is that the junior High, and that we go by now because there's an elementary school.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:07.000
But then, starting from the sun, and we went about I think It was maybe 37. she's to Mercury, and he says, now the size of mercury would be, and he had a staple would be like this you know whole of that

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
dude paper. you know about that no bigger than that. Wow!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000
We got out to Earth, and I think it was a paper clip size, you know, to punch through some, and just to kind of give us an idea of how big was the sun.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It was a softball give up something to build a sign where the softball and the size of these other ones would be something like that.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Oh, get out to Jupiter! It would have been the size of the hole in the middle of a record.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Huh! that's mighty large comparatively meet a single, a single or a Oh, gee!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
In an Lp: i'm sure yeah I thought it was just the other thing.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Yeah, because the earth being stable call what was Pluto, please? Well, I had the information all that you just punched with a paper clip.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah, the hole would be that kind of diameter and the diameter of a stable

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Never had the heaven before your book falls asleep, betrayed.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I have this whole paragraph written and now that I look at it.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:37.000
There's a much better way of doing it structurally just redo it, because I put this big parentheses here for what I might as well have done because he awakened at the and he got to hear, this and this and

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.000
This I interrupted with. he wake into the parentheses, the other does such a good job of describing this and everything else, especially Adams feelings, and he got to hear it totally totally breaks the

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
paragraph, and I should have just put this together, and then put the other.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:03.000
