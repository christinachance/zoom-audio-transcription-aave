@Comment:	Tastes Very Special
@Comment:	Face-to-face conversation recorded in a restaurant in
	Pullman, Washington. Sherry and Beth are sisters (in their late
	twenties), and Rosemary is their mother. The participants discuss
	what to order for lunch, interact with the waitress (Jamie) and
	engage in talk about family and friends while waiting for their food.
