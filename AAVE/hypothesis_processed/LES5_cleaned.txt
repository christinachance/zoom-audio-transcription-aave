well that we can get started officially okay i am and i am talking to tell me your last name is yes hi how you doing i am good so i normally ask people just sort of start at the beginning of their life so could you tell me when and where you were born okay i was born november the eleventh onenine hundred and eighty four brooklyn new york so i am originally in brooklyn night i lived in brooklyn up until i was three or four years old and then i moved to this apartment on atoms same of our same exact i have been living here for going on two thousand one hundred and twenty two years now that is amazing yeah so can you tell me a little bit about your family and their history like how did they end up in brooklyn and then here okay well my grandmother was from down south and you know she wanted to move blue south carolina she migrated up to an up to new york brooklyn she you know got married at you know my mother and my other aunts and own uncles and so my family you know was was breeded at i guess when we establish ourselves they moved around different parts of brooklyn above you know since when i was born lived in beth for stuverson and i swear the heart of our families at the buffer star is from brooklyn so why did you guys decide to move here well it was a pretty bad neighborhood at the time and my mother and my mother wanted to my mother and my eldest brother they wanted to you know move i was i was a kid i was like one or two years ago my sister was six months old and it was like we wanted to get a change of scenery or better but a neighborhood and this low east i used to be you know was kind of like a banning area that had a whole bunch of band buildings and squatters and it was a you know huge drug problem but the night said they actually you know made this development low east side too and it opened up in onenine hundred and eighty eight and so you know we were one of the first families that moved into this development yes we were and so i love these style these nitro buildings because they are so small it does not feel like you are not living in a big huge town it just seems like it must be nice and everybody pretty much knows each other for the most part i mean the great things we have a dead in block which has a school there shows like he is only pretty much one way you come in and when we come out what makes you know i mean which makes the community pretty much more close as we weed exactly i actually have a friend who lives right across the street ok ok so i have read down this block is it well you yes it is yes it is so i mean i had so many great times growing up in man yeah i was actually talking to one of my good friends or actually a childhood for know a couple of weeks ago and he just was something about like this we used to play kick bowl in a backyard and play all makeup games and you know play all different types of you know espionage you know man and games we used to have over there and it is like wow what are some of the other games that you are going we played i was very competitive so any type of sports play basketball or whatever then we would play a game called manhunt where you play man did you play man did you play manhattan so manhattan so man how well we do we used to you do a team two teams or you could do every man for himself and one person would you know one one person would be the person that go hide anywhere you want you know in the block yeah the whole blocked whole block thing that was that was a restriction you could not hide in the buildings you could not hide them apartments so you pretty much had to find different areas around the block to hide it under car well we have a big backyard we have a big backyard back there and we have a big backyard back here and we have a back and our other side too as well so we will hide there or how in the school yard we will just find different places to hide at and if you got caught if you got caught then you will have to join that person is after to define everybody else on everybody else was hiding and so if you got caught you had to join the team of the finals or the end exactly well if it was a scene though that is the thing if it was individual then i would have to save you the one that was it and we had a group of people if you caught me i will have to help you find everybody else and i slowly try to find everybody exactly and if it was a team though you would catch me and i would just be out for the rest you know there was like a prisoner is thing well i would have to stay there until you know until exactly but the catch is on certain occasions if one person from like say if i am on the opposing team then one of my teammates got caught i can you know if i can sneak sneaks and the base where you know when my team makes us that and tag them before the other team is able to notice me then they will be set free so so one of the teams had to leave guards yes exactly yeah that sounds fun this is like espionage one hundred and one backyards on both sides yes you had access to bulls not well like how did you get oh it is pretty much the same front door key the one we have the same front door key to get in so but then if not you knew friends from you know people from other side so you know you can always get it or you will climb the gate you do something to get to the other side of the backyard so i have seen the back there is another nature where is it on sixth street yeah exactly it is right up the block yeah and that backyard is like two times as big as ours yeah yeah it is a huge backyard huge and i have a basketball court back there as well yeah yeah well i did not i played pleading the park in thompson square park over there they are over there i would play the crazy movie young after a certain time you know when it got dark our parents would never let us go off the block so we used to have the garbage can there and we used to play basketball in the garbage camp and then at one point we had a basketball court at the end of the block we would have a portable one so we usually play all hours of the night until the neighbors start complaining and we have to take it away but you know growing up in this area there was always different different parks and recreations that you can go to so yeah so it sounds like you played on the blog and this is actually a nice block three street so you probably could play actually down in the street yeah well yeah for the most part we still got a lot of traffic coming in a lot of people did not know it was a dead and block or whatever the cases so i mean for the most part it still was not as bad as some of the main streets in regards to the two tracks that they get and you would also play in other places like go to the park and then when you when you are in school you meet you make friendships with people from different parts of the neighborhood so you know sometimes you go to their area and hang out and play sports or whatever the case was so you mentioned i think two siblings i have three to the brothers and i have a younger sister no actually my eldest brother just came back he just moved back in with us he was upstate he was upstate and i have another brother who is married and he is his wife and his daughter lives out in brooklyn and this is me and my sister here and did you know your father yeah i knew my father my father actually passed away three years ago to lung cancer so thank you thank you so i knew he was actually yeah he is my father yeah it is something that and did he live with you guys before that as he did you see their mother was married is but you know it is something that i have made peace with a while ago thank you and and so as you were growing up i am just curious what your parents you know did for a little while of working yes my mother used to actually work in the world trade center she worked in the world trade center and in the eightys and early ninetys and i wanted i used to be sick i used to be very sick and so she had to qu her job for us to go on welfare so she will be able to take care of me and my father i had asthma my asthma had immune deficiency and what else yeah when i was like yeah it is so i am a lot better now though how does asthma work is that a genetic something that is genetic well my second eldest brother had asthma i am not sure immigrants to how specific it is when it comes down to gonna be patched out but you know but i had it and my mother actually has asthma now and that is something that she developed she developed a couple of years ago it is too like if you are exposed to something like possibly i was festus or in a school or something like that because when i got it i was about three or four years old and i was not really exposed to well at least from my knowledge and i was not really exposed to it i think it could have been some i am not even sure but i want to have an asthma and i had new deficiency and so on me she used to be a computer operator she used to be a computer operator a master locksmith so in the neighborhood no actually in brooklyn in brooklyn so yeah that is what they did and well that must have been hard playing all these games if you like that is the thing it was pretty difficult at times and i always wanted to feel like i was just like everybody else and sometimes of course my medical conditions limited me from being able to enjoy some of the activities a lot of my friends were able to do but were you able to you know if you are your medication and things like that you are still able to run around yeah that was i was definitely i was in the necessity always had that i have my pump with me you know everywhere i went because i mean there was no telling when i was able to catch asthma attacking and i used to be in and out of the hospital a lot so it was something that i definitely had to i am so sorry not every day it would definitely be it was real consistent enough where i missed a lot of school and yeah i missed a lot of school and actually the doctors so once told my mother that one i would not live to see past the age of twelve yeah yeah yeah but i am looking at it i am going to be twenty five in november so it is definitely a blessing yes why would they say that asthma is not normally like a disease where you well it was not just necessary to add asthma was a major part of it but it was the simple fact that a mute deficiency you have a very very low immune system where i was not able to fight off a lot of the yeah and so i askedma would be the gateway where i will get the respiratory restaurant sort of my my breathing will be having out you know get sick from that but then i will be excited to so many other different types of germs and all that because my immune system was having a hard time fighting over just that i was always acceptable of getting you know catching a cold or some type of pneumonia and a lot of the times i have asthma as will bother me then i want them catching pneumonia or some other sickness involved with that it is you know what i was like i still you know and i mean everybody has this and everybody has their course that they have to go through that is just what my life was at the time definitely a lot more of course i am a lot more strong and i am a lot more appreciative of just some of the simplest things because i mean nobody thinks you know no seven or eight year old you know thinks about them not them dying or not being able to grow up and everything like that and i was a certain song that was a reality to me so and be able to come from that and the me i am now so it sounds like you dealt with it really hard yeah well i grew and the great thing is that i grew up in a church as well and i had out of my church family always prayed for me my mother and my parents you know i always pray so you know i always had that type of support so even though physically you know i was i was ill mentally and spiritually i always had to keep my spirits up that is great what else do you remember about the blog or the neighborhood at the time that you were growing up what was it like it was so different like i just sometimes were like amazing because you had a whole bunch of first he had a whole bunch of mom and pop stores here where there was a lot of people from the community that were doing well had their own businesses running and you know it was just something that was as a kid as a kid was not like oh wow i want to be a business owner but just to see somebody who looks like you or see like one of your friends you know parents or running the businesses like oh wow i can not believe you are doing it and what were the stores well i remember we used to have a candy store you know every kid loves a kid we used to have a teenage store like right on forestry right next to the forestry avenue sea right next to the grocery store that we have now you know thank you just candy and i used to have a field dated it is just candy and you know i used to have a field dated and video games so we used to have one used to be one on the third street and there was another one that was doubt i believe on eighth street and avenue see a for knife shirt or whatever and when i was old enough or when my mother used to make my brother take me somewhere we would go down to the game room know just play video games it was something that you see like always felt like i was not kind of like some type of sitcom where i was like wow and this plus it was completely different from what life was like in brooklyn because even though i moved there from my early age and i still have family initial i was always there so exactly and the community i guess the community was different not not simply just because the people the people were different there was a different level of success people were being prosperous over there because not only that they had their families they had their homes had their children to school they had their own business where it just lets you know like wow this is my community that i am living in and it was different in best side because you did not have i mean the neighborhood where my grand my family was at you know you definitely did not have a lot of black owned businesses and is not for the simple fact that they could not do it what was the simple fact that it just was not in their mentality to do it you know so so here there were osu as you mentioned the people are different so let us i do not know ethnic racial when you are growing up here of course there is a lot of it was a very heavy hispanic population and so another aspect especially sometimes you are always here you know some salsa marinee playing down the streets i know we have sometimes we will have like different street festivals and it will be people that be right outside in front of the building just for playing playing the bongos got you know just just playing just free music and people walking by kids playing in the park you know playing you know we have you know black parties and kids is riding their bikes it was just like euphoria you know what i am saying like as a kid everybody is out enjoying themselves they used to want it used to be real hot when we should really have heat waves we turn on the johnny pump if you look the crazy thing is if you look if you are going down different streets on like avenue see if you look down different blocks you will see different just a johnny pump home and it will be like you know you just see the water up in the head of one thousand and fifteen feet up in the edge just people getting away and just enjoying themselves and what about like the you know black or african american community yeah it was it was definitely the i mean the before your friends were they had a mix it was mixed and that was the great thing i loved about living in this area i mean i moved here so early on there was not to say that i knew why i was not though i was african american i knew puerto rican is the men against mexicans or whatever the case was growing up being exposed to just living with different type of people race was not that the race was never really an issue like that in regards to at least with me in regards to just being able to oh i am not going to kick it with him because he is so such and such and such nationality i was never like that and it did a lot for for everybody especially for me because as i got older i went away to school and all that you know just being exposed to people from different cultures and nationalities and maybe learn more about you know the maybe want to learn more about the rest of the world to learn about those cultures and being able to make me learn more about myself and what type of what type of school i wanted to go to them about psychologists because we had historically black colleges but i knew that growing up in this area i knew that going into historically black holes that was not my reality first so that was not the world is reality you were going to have to work with different types of people so you know i wanted to go to exactly exactly so yeah that would make sense so it sounds like you sort of felt like there was a lot of tolerance in the neighborhood that there were not i do not know tensions based on race yeah i did not see that much at least not for me you know but at the same time you know at the same time grown growing up when i really began to be conscious of you know be conscious of marsha community or whatever at that time when things were beginning to change that is when gentrification was kind of like the big thing and you know yeah and and not only that people were just beginning to move out move out and you know new people came in you know it is like you know so it was kind of like wow i knew that i was something different you know something different that was going on in regards to something different that was going on in general but i did not know how much it was empathing the rest of the community and not necessarily said it was a bad thing but by the time i became fully aware of what was going on the community had already changed but at the same time i came with the same approach that change is constant and you know what happens so you just have to kind of roll it yeah and i think i think the major thing in regards to the whole issue gentrification a lot of people feel different ways about it you know differently about it think that there is not a problem i think that you can not expect one neighborhood to be the same way it is all the time that is not i mean it is not going to happen not in ten times but i do think that they when you know gentrification is that much of a big issue i think it is important to be able to talk about it and not just talking about it amongst yourselves we will talk about it with the people who are you know who are coming into the community like you know they do not see it as oh you are the sure you are coming in trying to change and they do not look at it from that perspective you know they look at it is from egg moving into this gray area i have a new opportunity at life starting a new i want to make the most out of it and they might not realize exactly so what their presence is kind of exactly exactly exactly so i mean with that like i never was i was not angry about it i thought that they could have been more done in regards to what there was a relieved attention or what there was to make sure that people were given the fair treatment to be able to stay in their homes especially if they have lived there for extra money i was always against raising the rent to kick people who kick people out who we are the ones that we made this community what it was and it just completely disregard them as if they were nothing as if they were nobody so that you can be able to bring in somebody who is able to pay the pay the amount of rent that you want them to pay so i was always against that and that is because they are the one who and a war and control of doing it exactly let me ask you real quick just about your schooling history so did you go to schools in the neighborhood sure i want to all right i began i want to for thing was pre k pre and i went when i was i remember that was the first school i have been went to and i was nervous is right on toys you were nervous yeah a little nervous i remember the first days of school and i remember learning my abc is and i was like you know why is not one of leaving me here with these people i do not even know i remember doing that and then i went to attend the which is right here no first grade is sixth grade and after that i went to it is on and at the time it began from seventh grade up into twelfth grade so is that the high school that has that great yard with the skate card yes yes i always walk by there was not there when i was there yeah did you like those so you went there from seven through twelve seven to twelve it was actually it was one of the best schools i have ever gone to and you know first at first it was a challenge because my mother made me go to that school because i wanted to go to school where all my friends were going so junior high school fifty six junior high school twenty two all these different you know school that was around away and she was completely against it because she knew of course if i was going there with rest of my friends were you know it was easy more easily for me to be influenced to do you know kind of do the wrong thing and school more yeah well you know with numbers and i was never a bad kid i was never a bad kid you know so what she she was adamant and megani then i was like you know what okay because that was just different it was a different it was an alternative school i am plotting on the one thing that that was great about it is that my mother you know my mother actually had a chance to sit down and speak with the principal at the time who was the founding principal and it was and and she really spoke to her about it listen i want to take my census for where you get a proper education and be able to be exposed to just you know new things that will be able to benefit on the long run and i want to go and eat and it was it was tough at first because i do not know practically i really know anybody there so just meaning everybody in elementary school we knew each other for the most part from first grade up until sixth grade and now i am in this new school where practically really do not know anybody at all and trying to meet new friends you know it was it was a tough transition at first i mean i want to meet in some good people there you know by the time i was in eighth grade though i was a really channeled myself and my academics and i want them going out to dc our first year eighth grade i want to go in the dc for a program due to you know my academics and then the following year in that gr i went to chile for two weeks at school took us in chile and the great thing is that the great thing is that they prepared us for college and they have always prepared this for the next level but it always prepared us for the next level so it was there was an expectation that you would yeah you have to work exactly and you know i that is when i really i know i wanted to go to college that is when i really began to gained my confidence academically what i was able to do and what is up you know what type of colleges that i know i wanted to go to i mean ninth grade i was looking at yale university and brown and all these diabetes schools and it was because i was that sure and confident of myself that you know i was able to i think my ninth grade had a gpa of threeeight like you know what i worked hard and you know the great thing is that the reason i was able to work the hours because of the teachers and administrations that were there they always encourage you they always took the extra time that working on a different project which you projects with you that you were dealing with or even if there was some assignments that you did not complete they lay listen this is what you need to do and the prince its predecessor who is currently the principal now he was so influential in regards to just the whole student body and bring a new activities to the school we had a liberal arts program where i when i first first really you know guys into poetry and i want to develop in my poetry skills and i developed a passion for it and so it was just so many things that they exposed us to take us to college do college trips early on just to allow more mentally than anything allowing us to know that we were able to get into these colleges and we belong to college it was a great great school to go to grade school to go to i mean it was some of the best times i had in my life there that is great so you did poetry what else were you going to basketball very i was a big basketball fan and the only one thing i do regret is that i never i never tried out for the basketball team i never did that i mean it is whatever so you played it as a hobby yes and chess chess is another thing i was interested in and i took drum i took acting classes i used to say yeah they exposed this to a lot of stuff and they will constantly go on school trips each year we went to montreal went to boston of philadelphia we just went to different places and it was a great experience especially you know as a high school student going with your school to just different different places around the country around the world it was nothing like it so that is so wonderful and so what do you do afterwards afterwards i am sad to go to for college how did you like that hey we know what it was tough it was more tough socially more than anything you were in high school you see all these movies about what college is like and then i go to college and there is nothing like it it is nothing like it and i went to a small private university it was not a duke i lived on campus as well was on the main campuses in garden city new york so yeah that is too far to me yeah so i lived on campus it was his first of freshman orientation it just rained it rained like all day and it was like a torrential rank monsoon ring and you know what i am saying it raining you moving there and i was just like oh dad this is college you would say it was not a good start to my college career and so i just really was not into it i was you know i was city boy you know and i am in this you know on the weekends everything was that everybody went home for the weekend for the most part and yeah a lot of people were home for the week because it had we had dorms but it was a big community school as well and not a lot of people from the city a lot of people from the city did live live in brooklyn i mean live on campus but there was not my freshman year the campus life it just really was not as you know as good as it was in the later years we really developed over the years campus really really became like wow this is great this is what i want it to be yeah and i actually thought about after my first man i actually really considered transferring from a tuskegee university but then i decided to stay and and from my sophomore year on after my sophomore i really fell in love with the school and i really began to challenge myself academically and just sha which is me and new people and just talking talking to new friends and not just kind of like you know stay in the box in regards to who i was going to be able to you know who did i think that i was going to be good friends with and you know i just tried to just meet different types of people and i went there and i graduated in twosix on a grad degree and i went back to buffalo high school in twoeight i got my masses and business administration so twoeight that is recently it is terrified nope so what are you what do you have to know what do you want to do well i was working in politics for about a year i was working in policies i worked for city council for councilmember for you which was an experience the crazy thing is prior to that that summarizes graduated was not really searched on this is when the economy was really you know it was really people began to start saying we are in a recession so you know i am exactly right and i mean i was not really stretching into it because i went to school six years straight and i was like you know let me just take this some off and just relax so i wound up by the end of the time i want to joining a nonprofit organization i was just doing some part time work there and within that period i was there to develop a great relationship with the ceo of the organization who happened to be friends with the city councilmember i was looking for you know some new talent it was introduced there and pretty much that is how the story here you work i worked for yeah i was a senior community she was already in office she was already in office so you were her webinar her senior community liaison which basically meant that i helped out with different constituents who came to our office they had problems or issues in regards to payment rent in regards to being evicted and rent in regards to being evicted or looking for jobs like we would get in contact i would get in contact with different city agencies to see what they can do to help them now so i would do that i was also you know write her species i was a speechwriter you know i did organize events for i was speaking on our behalf at different events i did a lot of stuff i liked it i liked it a lot i liked it for the simple fact that i learned a lot it was a very very stressful environment yeah it was very very very special because you know it was as everything was going she she was always on the go she was not necessarily the best manager so you know a lot of stuff that we had to do and we was in the biggest district in the city council forty first district and at the time we had much and we were a young staff you know my chief of staff was twenty three and i was twenty four and you know i was like second in command and then you know her schedule her special system was twenty four as well so we were like and we had like other couple of the staff members over there but it was pretty much the chief of staff myself i am who is a specialist and we were kind of like we ran the office it was a great great experience like i said it was very very stressful a lot of times but we did well we definitely we definitely did well and i think we want an artist working people arguably in the city council in regards to the amount of work that we had to do and still be able to run the office at the same time and still put on the events and a community from january to july we put on about at least twenty five to thirty events decided this year of this year so did you decide to leave or what happened me and her oh this you know i could say is well she definitely a large for she definitely felt threatened by us in regards to her staff because we know we were young very educated chiefish staff and myself had masters she did not know exactly and she felt she felt threatened by it and so because of that she actually let go me and our chief for staff on the same day yeah that is traumatic yeah but you know the thing is we were kind of she tried to it is been more than a couple of times where she would you know she would try to set us up for failure we had she forced us to work behind campaign and we had to do a fundraising in three days and raise twozero which is like you know three days to do a fundraise and raise twozero that is pretty ridiculous but we want to raise in threezero for it was a very very was very it was amazing yeah so what is your next well my next step is i am i am doing community organizing now yes i am i am doing community organizing now we actually had so you see those boxes over there we had a back oh they were over there back there we had a back in school event will we help who are you working with i am working by myself so yeah i am working my mother and the great things my mother is the attendant associate president so we just do events to our development which allows me to be able to work more independently just with myself and my mother pretty much i have a lot of control in regards to what type of events we want to do so i am doing that a lot and i am also helping them with a couple of campaigns who is a city council member not district i actually helped our reelection campaign where she wanted to get eighty two to vote so that was a major yes yes of the major success and we have we are developing a pretty good relationship as well you want to stay in this kind of arena i think i can see myself doing that my main focus now is that city council member and so my main focus is the community itself so i am just committed to doing whatever we can to make sure that we provide our community resources limited amount of violence and illegal activity is going on here and just making sure everybody is happy or making sure for the most part and we are living in our harmonious society that is pretty much what i am interested in doing and thank you thank you very much maybe i can switch gears and just ask you a little bit more about how you have seen the neighborhood change in your twenty four well twenty one we talked a little bit about it yeah what else comes to mind when you think of have you seen it change over time it is definitely become more upscale in regards to just different type of businesses that are just in regards to the different type of people who are around here which is like i said is not a bad thing it is not a bad thing at all because changes not necessarily change is constant i just wish that there were more you know more businesses that were here you know for a lot of people who are i wish there was more business here that people from people who grew up here are able to start on their own and i think i think a lot of it has the reason why we do not have it is not because they do not want to just the amount of money they have to afford to pay rent open and you know it is tough there is a boutique that it is tough exactly and the great great example of it on six weeks to have like this it is an amazing chinese restaurant right on six street in avenue sea and i mean he was there since i can remember they want them shutting down because they could not afford to rent or whatever the case was and now we have a wine so there which you know wine i am an avid wine lover but it just lets you know that it is a shift you know this this on business was the since i can remember since i was a kid and it is unfortunate that that no one could be here because of the fact that they can not afford it and there is no fault to the wine store because you know they did then their business and then they are trying to open up shop here it is a great neighbor so so much and so forth but i just think that i wish there was more i wish there was more that could be done to make sure exactly exactly exactly so you have seen some of these negative effects yeah exactly exactly now a lot of people talk you know have seen this this name this area right here is seen a lot of gentrification you do not have any kind of moving now over so much so that sometimes when i interview people it is interesting if you are all over the lower east side when i told you this is the glory side project they will define the lower east side little differently and they sometimes think of this as a separate neighborhood so i am curious what you think like if i asked you what do you think the lower east side is what do you do graphically where is it go you know what are the like cross streets that wow i think the low east side is from of course from avenue d the old session of avenue d and over towards where williamsburg is at and it is it is pretty lowie side is pretty big we know how how north does it go how far north would you go first of all you think you live in the laurie side yes i do hmm to the north meaning like up towards like to fourteenth street i would say yeah i would think i do not even think it will go that far up until i think louis side is up into i want to say up until yeah up until forty shi and about avenue avenue a okay and then east of that first step of that i do not think that is not the lower east side and then what about moving south yeah you cross house and still the land yeah the lancey still because i think it is the after past the lancey you know what after peg you go i do not believe only i want to step into like about grand street i would consider that to be like the holy side yeah i would consider that and then what about east of there because you have got chinatown jeep does that seem part of laurie is most chinatown is chinatown yes the boundaries of where yeah it is funny everyone i ask has a totally different definition of what the lower is but so i am curious if so say we use your definition of the boundaries do you think that all the people that live from fourteenth street to grand and the river to avenue a or whatever it is do they make up a community and i guess i would ask you to define what is community what does it mean for people who live in an area whoa community and not just people who live next to each other well i think it is different i definitely think i see this black as being one community very small yeah because you know the thing is the thing is that you could we all grew up everybody who is lived in this block it is pretty much watched watch each other grown up we have been friends or since we were kids you know and so there is a there is a history that is there and there is a common bond that we shared it so you know that is what makes that is what makes it special we have fifteen avenue de i barely know anybody that is over there or people i know is like you know we we have known because we have grown up we went to the same school or you know our parents may know each other but we necessarily were never friends but you know there is a mutual respect that is there but that does not necessarily they are a part of our community but they are kind of like the distant cousins you know what i am saying as like and i think just in the low east side is a neighborhood itself dependent i think you basically committed on at least for me i am regards to the people who you who you kind of grow up with basically who you interact with yourself because i live on there is not so many people who are associated with on life street you know but we are still in the same area does not mean that you know we are from two completely different
