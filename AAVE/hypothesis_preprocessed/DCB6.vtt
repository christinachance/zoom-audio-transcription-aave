00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And like that was the first home that I felt like I was like, I grew up, like when I was a towel. That's why I grew up in.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Hi, how are you, I'm fine. How are you,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:01.000
so Okay, tell me about the house, what you remember, I remember when I was a child, and I like doing different things in the house like my mom and my grandmother used to tell me things to get I used to walk around the house without turning out one night,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and go downstairs today room and lay with them.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Do you remember that. Do you remember how it was laid out rooms like what can we see, I haven't gotten home cuz I slow Mama.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
She had. She won't even a man Okay.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tell me Hey, how many so it was my level.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
My grandma.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It was it now in a basement and then we had.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And then we had like it was like this extra money for this house. it was basically.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Okay, and so do you remember playing outside you play in the house. Do you have like a big TV Did you watch TV, yeah watch TV and I, I used to play outside like only in a winter winter Congress, one winter.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I was like, some habits and a grace and like it was frozen to a block. And that's why I went outside and I got slammed on it.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So you just like us the heel to be as live. Okay. Okay.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
What about summertime, summertime.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I usually usually might just go to the pool I go to a hotel.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What you mean you just went to a hotel to hotel.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So I think some of that has to do with the fact that in our neighborhood.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It was no kids. So it was more like to retire older people that have some money. And so it was no kids that are neighbors quiet or you go outside you pay a pin drop and so it wasn't a case for him to play with, essentially.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And so, in order for him to have fun. My mom was just taking them to a different hotel so those lemons for movies and stuff like, okay, they were no neighborhood swimming pools are no neighborhood, recreation centers, it was but at that's have gone up

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So, okay.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Then, tell me about.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I want you to tell me about like what you like your parents, your mom, your grandma your grandpa like growing up like how do you remember that dynamic. But what's your fondest memory of your laughing so something popped into your mind.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Right.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It was funny in that house like it was so funny like every day was like, I was like, my grandma used to argue Monday. Know migrated into the new flooring.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And then my mother used to argue my grandmother. And he, he, like everything was is fighting me.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
My granddad, he was fighting is what he died.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I used to be in a house laminar flow.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It was so funny.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Listen things that he did.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Crispy without it was so funny.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I knew him he was to me Jonah No, it was fine.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We used to tell jokes and layer

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:33.000
where you really close to your grandpa. Very, very polite, if I got in trouble. Hey, go for now rather dad. That was your router that, yeah.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So, what do you, what did you most like, because I know he passed. So what do you remember about him most like I know he was funny but what do you personally remember about him like he was like one of my first father because my father wasn't around a

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
lot when I was like, eight.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And so okay.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And what do you what lesson did he leave like what do you feel like he taught you as a man as a you know as a young man. He taught me how like to like.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000
He told me like how to grow up to be a man like he taught me like, how to do certain things like he taught me how to ride a bike.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Like, he didn't do it around like he had my level on gramma method.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And like, it was just like he didn't do it alone.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He always had a team that had his back.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
he was a family man so everything will expand.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We are really close knit.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But it will be just our household so I Vidya house well I mean we have a high schools and cousins, but within our house by very close, very close.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So, let me ask you this.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Have you gone back to that house. I mean like I path, but like I never just like stopped at it and just looked at it and like, it'll pop back memories but like every time I read page.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I like had like a flashback of me playing in the backyard.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Okay. And when you say

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you just have flashbacks but you never stopped by the house does the neighborhood still look the same. Do you think it's changed based on like when you were I mean, maybe what a few years ago.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I remember saying look the same, the house look the same. On the outside to put the answer.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Totally different they remodeled, and they're like crazy. It's crazy. Alright so let's talk a little bit about your relationship with your sister.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Okay, and we'll get you out of here in a few minutes.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
One on 14 glow day.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So tell me about growing up with a sister who was 12 years older than you.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Okay, let's go back.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
When I was little, my sister.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
She used to irked me about anything.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:39.000
She did I have everything prepared for some, like save like we'd be going out. Make sure you get everything ready, the day before that, in the nighttime lab.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Before like she was your second mom, my partner in crime.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
But I was your partner in crime, yes I mean, I when I got in trouble for students that they used to do in school.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So you could have an explanation for Donald Trump.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Do you agree.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000
She came I told me she could go back until the last

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
term.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Okay. Oh, tell me, man. Thank you, Grandma, I didn't get to that part.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So, sometimes I had a lot, so like I was the Master Hand go see when I was little, because I was like, I was like, skinny and bony.

That was like my childhood cartoon character he's my favorite.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So, I climbed up the wall and I got on the ceiling, so they won't.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They walk past me like seven times in a row, I'm pretty sure I think my mom song but I think she may say no but she really didn't say, so I have to harness it, they won't pay me like six times so I thought it was funny so I said on the wall.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Now as I want to see it. Then asthma grandma has one more time, I say grandma, she said, when I was like, I want to say like she was like, she was like, No, no, I was like, look up, she saw he saw, right.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:35.000
So, I'm beating, and that's why he didn't moved and that's what I was like, I hate to do that. I can do it too. So I didn't move work for couple of for couple of weeks, and I got it down, then yeah, and then.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Mommy got to the way the micro death.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And the whole family would be in the living world doing Michael Jackson, I used to be all invented the only person to ever be me was like MA in se Yama Yama. So how did you start dancing for whiskey.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
