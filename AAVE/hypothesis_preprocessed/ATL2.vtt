00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Where'd you go. So I party.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
White people there. All right, like your clothes always close, it was all my birthday party. Okay, cool thing.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Did you see anybody at the party would not all white.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Of course, I want to be different oh we're black, because just because we're so what happened is that all white party I never been before.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I mean it's different things. I mean, it depends on what type of party he goes if you go say American, an American or white party might be different type of music people might act different maybe go so like a Caribbean side, which I went to get like a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
different reaction because like you know different music, and stuff like that so.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Okay Okay, um,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
When you came down here from eight years ago. I'm assuming that the culture was a little bit different.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
What was some of the things you noticed that was different about being in Atlanta Dan, and New York.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Um.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
When I first came on it. Obviously, there wasn't like things weren't that close, it was stressful because I had to get arrives I go everywhere. Also when I went to school.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Like with teachers with different accidents like that come from different countries like the West Indies and you know like other places that kids will make fun of them and now we'll kind of get to me a little bit I don't know if it's because, you know,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:51.000
my parents are from a different country or if it's because you know it's something that I'm used to because being in New York every is everything is diverse so you know nobody's different from anybody else, you know.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Okay, that's pretty interesting.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Um, let's see. What about a crew, you got a particular crow you hang with now.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
How's that we accrue like we're cool like I have yet Right, right.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay. So what would I do I like on a typical weekend.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
weekend or pie go out for a party or to a club or to a lounge or go bowling, or something, or studio.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Studio. Are you good in any of those environments can you bow Can you sing a little bit, and like a thing a little bit but I'm sure song you know singing in a studio.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
That's cool. Um, let's see.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So I'm assuming that you went to middle school and high school here. No, no, I went to high school out here, you went to high school.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
My school

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is a. Okay. How was.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
How was that experience.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I didn't like it at first because I didn't know anybody and I didn't want to be.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But after a while it was cool.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Like a lot of different clubs, you could join and different activities and stuff at school like I was in choir there and I used to stay after school and do like some choir practice and stuff like that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And we will have like recitals and stuff.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Oh, nice. Okay, okay.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Outside acquire Did you have any favorite subjects in school.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Oh, like science.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I like, I like, I like science, I think I started like a science when I was in junior high school because I had to teach it I really used to push me a lot.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And like I was making good grades, I was like, you know, like kind of like this I'm making good grades.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And you know you can learn a lot with science so basically everything you do, equal up with some science.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What's your least favorite subject in school math. Okay.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They say math and kind of go with everything as well too.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But why why why is maps, the most least favorite so as hard like you feel like you get something you write everything down and you feel like you get in some way and then it ends up being wrong especially algebra Oh my god, don't get me started.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Okay.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Let's see what else we got. Um How, how far was your career, from the school from school here or school near law school here like could you walk to school, or would you. I mean I could walk by me dead by the time I get.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I mean driving. It's like five minutes walking is like 20 was used to do a lot more walking back.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Did you take the bus to school. Yeah. Awesome. Sounds good. All right.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
How many fights in school did you fight. I've been getting a lot of fights out here.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When I was in New York, Atlanta maybe to a man like bad kid so I didn't really use a lot of fights I mean a lot of people don't like me but they wouldn't have to do nothing so.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Okay.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Was there any type of games for fun match I would play either in school out of school. Whatever.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I'm

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:02.000
not a high school me I know when I was in New York when I, when I was in junior high, I would leave my house extra early to go to the park in the morning time to swim on the swings as old as I was in junior high I could still fit on the swings early before

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:16.000
class in the morning show you one double dutch and how does a lot of hopscotch and jump regular road but I can never get double dutch need to figure that out.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
might be too tall.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We'll try. Um, let's see.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
What was your first job.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
My first job

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
was at a lot on machine, it was for a summer. It was at a nursing home.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I was at a lot of machine.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then when I came to Georgia. It was at a daycare, and I was at the front desk.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So a lot of machine does in New York, and I was like 15 or just like a summer thing.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You feel like you got a lot of good experience from that first job or whatnot. Yeah, dealing with people and dealing with, you know, different attitudes because you know a lot of people come in and they got attitudes about the lotto.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Um, let's see. Do you have any siblings. Yeah. Okay.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
What are you the youngest oldest or your clothes I'm the youngest. Okay.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Let's see.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Did you feel like you was treated differently because he was the youngest or whatnot.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Oh,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
yeah.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Okay.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I'm, I'm more close with my mom died.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.000
My dad side I mean, I have somebody live in New York and then some Bellamy St. Vincent, Bonnie went there one time, and I don't really, I mean I talked to them every now and again but I don't see them.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So I'm more closer my mom's family.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Okay.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What kind of dishes Can you remember growing up.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I can remember.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I had a lot of birthday parties, and we had a lot of parties to like in the summertime used to have like a big barbecue. And that's my favorite time like it was so much fun like everybody you see for that you didn't see for a while come around, it'll

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
just be like, you know, old times it'll be fun.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
When you get the opportunity, do you plan on keeping those traditions alive. As

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I like to go out and I like to have fun and I like my culture so of course I'm going to keep that in my family I want my kids to know about their culture and our culture last we say about your culture.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Will you say about your culture. You mean specifically.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:18.000
New York culture, like Caribbean like, I'm from New York but I consider myself like my mom is from and like, because I love that type of music. I love the whole Carnival experience, the whole you know everything about it is, is beautiful so.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So how many Carnival type events have you been to in your lifetime.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Oh, all of them, I mean I've been playing.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:59.000
carnival. So carnivals they do those in America, and outside of America right you've done one outside of America, yeah when I went to St. Vincent for the first time I played

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
very, very impressive. Oh and Canada, and he can twice. Twice.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Okay.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I think it's a great thing I love the festivities. From the outside looking in, I want to participate one day.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tell me something about the costumes and stuff like that because they look extravagant are they, expensive or they're very expensive.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:46.000
For frontline costume you're paying almost $500 for mid line three back line, the lease is like 250.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Oh, like, yeah, and if you're playing like like a queen like a king or of the band it's like almost 1000. So, so you say Queen but me say King guys dress up to all the millions of pitches are saying the people at Carnival I have yet to see a guy in some

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
type of costume person. I mean, they don't have the extravagant feathers and stuff like that like this, it was a.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If it's the king.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yeah, yeah, if it's a, if it's a king, then you have like a you have basically like a train on you that the customer was has like wheels.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So it'd be easy for you to maneuver in it but if you're playing like a regular you know like regular costume. You're not going to really know, like, you might see a guy, but you're not going to notice what he has on because it's only almost the guys are

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:53.000
just shirtless with shorts and like some kind of jewelry around the neck or something like that and a headband, it's nothing too extravagant when you're just playing with the band like, but when it's like the king or queen is, you'll notice those stand

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
out because it's huge.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Definitely, definitely.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Um, Let's see.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This randomly. What's your thoughts on the whole R Kelly situation if you heard of it. Anything. Have you heard anything in the news lately. Well, not like me.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Okay, well, like maybe a couple weeks ago. Yeah, yeah, that's where I kind of refer to apparently he's like, you know, got chicks in some type of dungeon situation I'm not sure how true that is but just based off of that.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
What's your thoughts.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I mean I really don't know. I can't speak on something I don't know because we weren't there when you know he approached these females or whatever the case may be.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So I really don't know and I can speak on it because I don't know, does the accusation affect the way you listen to his music do you still, still listen to his music, you still love his music, still sound bumping I shut all away ago.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Okay, why are you why you say, I say, in particular, because I know he got us a situation to going on right now, but that doesn't affect how I listen to his music we make good music you make good music is actions don't have nothing to do with me listening

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to what he was singing about. So, okay, very very interesting, very, very interesting.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I've been asking some everybody this question. Did you see the eclipse.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But, yeah, it got dark, and I just thought it was about to rain. I didn't, I didn't remember.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So, I was sleep

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000

I haven't really even been watching TV like that. Honestly, I can tell, I can say, when I come in the house my TV's on the same channel for about three four days, but when I do watch TV I watch power, a lot of stuff be on record to so much power insecure.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I don't even like loving hip hop like them what is crazy.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I like scary movies so if there's a scary movie or a scary show I'm watching it like True Blood days to be my show, but it doesn't come on anymore.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Yes scream is good, it was cheesy at first but I like it.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Like some shows on Netflix I do black people. I mean they're white people.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Pretty Little Liars this sound familiar.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
This is show. This is serious.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
See

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I'm ready for the one tomorrow, ready for the season finale, and this season.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Well, I know what I'm doing after this interview, not awake caught up in his power.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So tomorrow.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Really want to speak on power some more and I haven't watched it enough to spoil it for you. So, I don't care i'm gonna watch it.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Let's see, what about fashion, are you into fashion is that a big deal to you or not, not really.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I like anything that looks nice. I mean I'm not a label donkey donkey Yeah, like if I can afford it and it looks nice. I'm getting it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And was, was afforded something in your text for a moment, like how, how much would you pay for a fly shirt that you like

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
the most app is probably like

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
30 $40.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
More for sir. Oh,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
what about shoes.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
shoes, is a really good pair of shoes. price kind of like 100, and some chain.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Yes it, but like, if it's like I'm not gonna go extravagant like it red bottoms or something, if it's just not my birthday or something like, if it's my birthday then okay I see if it's been like that 809 hundred for some red bottoms.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
But I mean, like I said, if it's cute, and is $20, and forget it.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So where do you see yourself in the next five years.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Oh.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Hopefully I have my Rn or my CNA by then, and I'm working probably as a traveling nurse, and

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
probably started my career.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Opening a senior living home I want to open a senior living at home.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Okay.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That's pretty commendable lot of people forget about old people, especially right now at their, you know, peak of adulthood coming into it right out of passion.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
want to help older people like that.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Or is the money thing.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I mean the money's gonna be good too, but I've been working with, with older people for a while, and

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it's crazy because like family members, they tend to forget about the, your mom or dad or aunts, uncles, and at the end of the day, their family becomes us the workers, so I just always have like a soft spot for them.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And they're sweet like I mean they at some point in life that's going to be me. You know, so I want somebody to care about me. And remember me and take care of me, if I need it, you know,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
another random was out there.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Have you ever broken any balls. know, who.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What about.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Let's see.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Let's see.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Do you use lotion.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Of course I you

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
know cuz you know, I don't really matter, but what kind of lotion. If it.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Oh, it's a big tub of coconut, I mean cook cocoa butter.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:48.000
You can get it from Sally's or $1 store or Walmart. Okay, so you prefer, and sometimes I'm mixed like oil with it. I can teach you all of a sudden, put the lotion in Miami and then I put the order together because I'm dark skin so I got to keep smooth,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:00.000
or sometimes raw coconut oil.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
spores.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
When's the last time. You've been back to New York.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Oh wow, maybe like two three years

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
now.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Only one It seems like forever. Okay, so, so what, how, what have you noticed change when you went back to your old neighborhood or just wherever your

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
building is or people, I noticed like they're building a lot.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:49.000
They build on a lot of apartments like they've been in a lot of places up like I know downtown Brooklyn they're building a lot of laughs and condos and stuff, they're going to net especially since the stadium is out there they want it to fit the image

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I guess so.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And like my old that turned into a party like when you go outside his music playing is a whole bunch of different restaurants now,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
a big family dollar.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So nice nice nice.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000
What about your friends do they feel like and change that most drastic and really at least like the way you talk now.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I'm just sometimes they hear what they say sometimes they hear but not all the time. Okay. And that's maybe because I keep in contact with them too So, and then some of my friends out here there's some new or two.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000
or new way type of phrases or slaying a US.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Oh, they say, It's late.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:09.000

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
what is possibly a movie. Okay.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Some other stuff I can think of it, it comes more on when like when you talk again.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Crazy. Okay.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Right. It may say I have incompetent pseudo, what about as far as Atlanta I know you know, a few phrases for being here.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
They say bra.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Everybody say they say bro, bro. When I first came on here bro.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So, so what else. So this is different between so is Sit. Sit. Sis, slideshow says that he doing some ices relaxing, so they'll say bros much they're not as thought you know what matters on to say, bro.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:20.000
but she'll say like bro, but she like bra, or bro. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so we got we got. So, so that

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I don't really know.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I mean, I gotta say I gotta help you out with this more when if I was in high school, because now I don't really have that much people that are from like out here that I hang out with.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Okay. And if they are they adapting to how we talk how New Yorkers.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Or you know, how other you know other places to work. Okay. So who approached you more guys or girls, guys. Okay.

So when guys approached you are they more so.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Atlanta type of guys being in Atlanta or is it more of a different type of person.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Usually, it's a little bit about this a little bit of both. So, let's say, Atlanta guys coming at you with some of the typical wise you feel like they'll probably hit you with or how are they trying to go about.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Sometimes they will like the other day I was at the store.

We failed.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Let's see

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
If I'm at the gas station gas.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So they don't even do no type of introduction, they just come on out with it like they just know you're right. Okay, that's cool.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:30.000
How do you feel about people who call you miss lady that you feel some type of way about that. Not really. What about, man.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
