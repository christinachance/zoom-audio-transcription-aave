When I got school for them when they went to the same high school. Yeah, that's it, and only person that really talked to enable is is also in Canada.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Okay, and that the army in the neighborhood and then yeah both decide to work here, or.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Now we met and they were like it was long time ago, when he was young.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So yeah, I've known each other for like just became friends, not as have asthma.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Oh.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Okay, so have Jeremy, a row kid over around, you just hanging out. Yeah, neighbors, neighbors, neighbors, and then we start playing whichever cuz I wait wait no friends was literally.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And then we start playing with each other, because I we had no friends was literally. No, nobody was really around it for, it was like oh grownups, and then people moved out and then.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But I missed the opener.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Was it was like, you know, it wasn't too much drama, like now is people moved in and does too much. What do you mean like what are they doing, fire, everything.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Do you feel like you say, No, it's not wanna just, is it like drill know, like, just guns is it just people like whatever you unite you could think of.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
That's what they known around me.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Is this sometimes it'd be a little quiet, like the sheep Be quiet, but other times I will be on.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And they're really remember we lie, you know, I'm just walking around just walking around, because I like walking so I'll be walking around like anybody gonna do an anime.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And for me, and they know me. So, would they go Do you feel like people in a neighborhood protect each other. Yeah. Yeah, we do, but you never know what could happen so.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:20.000
So if it's like other people who come in, so most of the violence is stuff that happens is people who come in from the outside. Yeah. Sometimes there isn't like turf like is it battle like is it turf wars.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is even some ideas from our neighborhood to them already some to us. I don't know, for them to come around and even shoot up the place over.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Have you like your I'm saying like at one point did you ever feel like something was gonna happen to you or never. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I wouldn't know because anything carpet in time so it could be one day, you never know, but I can just walk you ever

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:00.000
ever it was every time you felt like really scared like oh my god something's going to happen. No, no, no, no, no, cuz you can't. You can't escape because you're no you don't know what can happen, Right.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Because if you scared and there's no point in me going I was walking into your prison in your own home. Yeah, so this is why.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Go ahead and go off at the walk to work. No, take

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
a long walk.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I mean I walked to Minnesota from my house, but not as a blocking this morning.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:37.000
But it was a lot of carbohydrates I couldn't stop but I saw her walking shoes by Minnesota. Right. You know where that little whatever that building yeah like I say if I'm all Minnesota and the bust cycle Albuquerque, does not therefore, oh I walk from

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
my house to themselves, they get on the bus is one of the other day, actually when it's cold.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I know next year.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
My other questions, I just want to ask a couple more.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
So your first job was, or did you have any other jobs.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Oh yeah, I worked that well now.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Now, I started working it

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
was that there's also a bonus role like you have different parties and stuff.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:26.000
It's like a, like a builder that you just run it out. Yeah, but we do outside of it because it's the moon bounce and stuff like moon bounce ice cream machine candy machine for things like you've done a lot of work with kids, but are you but you're not

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000
going into, like, education or something like that you're going into sport. So how did you go from. Why do you do all your work with kids but you going into something totally different.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
This, I mean, this is like the set this up. Yeah.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I'm not me so it's like I said, basically, after work with the kids and then I want to do something nice to just in case anybody tell me that, like, I'm the teacher.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Well, I don't see myself as a teacher, because I'm just hearing all your stuff that you do with the kids but I mean you have a good administrators. I will say you do a lot of good administrative work like keeping stuff, you know, stuff that we just don't

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
have time to do like the lunch snack thing that you know women.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:25.000
So I can see you doing strong like you do strongly with the administrative stuff but you also do really really good with the kids. That's why I'm just surprised that you know you're going into sports and when I'm not surprised about the broadcast and

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
part.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
What do you think your, what are you looking forward to the most in college.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:46.000
This getting migraines and meeting new people, what do you what do you the most scared about leaving Ey, even I want to get away,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:58.000
because I've been here for my life life.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I have but I just I just, just to call it, not like all around. So how's it going to be when you can just get on the metro and go some way or you can get on the bus, I mean they got a shuttle bus, that's a good places, but it's nothing like I won't have

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:24.000
my car to make sure it is like city. It is not like DC. Now it's not like DC, they keep talking about is like the server.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.000
No, it's not like a rural area like is not like that. Because when I've been adding see like that, like, you know, like you're on a farm or something.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
No, it looks like city is like city city, to me, is not the same but it's like city.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:53.000
So you're not doors. It doesn't say stores like right across the street or not that far and then Walmart is 20 minutes away so that means the city if it's warmer.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Yes, their Starbucks, oh no you don't drink.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I don't drink. Okay, that's always my, my requirement, but I don't know, I don't know, it might disclose that the more I need to know the more. Yes, I know, I know why this 20 minutes away and the shuttle bus taking you know because your first year you

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
can no car.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Oh that's their rule. Yeah.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000
But if you do like, like say for, and I get like a, you know, like a certain grade point average, I think you have it, you know I'm saying, So like your first year.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Yeah, basically. So what sort of fall semester might be after the fall semester I might be able to bring my car for the spring and the rest of the campus.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:54.000
roommate. Yeah, it's your first time, you only Chow, are you excited about it. Yeah, cuz, cuz it's like, like the last like a sister to me.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Yeah, like a sister, not literally but, right, like a sister. Is it like a mixed campus is it black and white is just black not its own i'm not sure i think it's like Vanna White.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:27.000
black yeah it's mostly back but they, they said it's some reason why do you feel like, let's go back to that for a second because right now all the stuff that's going on we especially like black men do differ like the city default like this a lot of racism

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
in the city, and DC.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Do you know OCDMI sometimes Yeah, like what, why, what do you see, like when we go to the stores.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:55.000
They might think, Oh, I'm a girl though it might still think I'm better six or seven in the store.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I get them 711, maybe thinking about this deal.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So it's not even like white and black is like other cultures and other races that feel we're gonna do something because you black. Yeah.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Do you see that in like certain parts of town more like if you got one kid award that's kind of like mostly black right. Yeah, but if you go let's say uptown or you go to Columbia Heights or you go, se or Northwest Do you feel like certain groups when

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
you go certain places they look at you differently.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure because I haven't like been in the stores that she just, like, wherever that she just name, I haven't been like the stores in the area.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I'm not sure, but it'd be like Japan A or B.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I'm not sure, but it'd be like Japan a or they sometimes they do sometimes they don't like life UX down for extra cheese or whatever edge play every game may this put it on my end my bow,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000
where we're, like, just falling anywhere, anywhere, the Mexicans.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So you've had just different interaction Yeah, yeah, cuz I was arguing with the lady.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:21.000
The message he was this is some, this is some, this is some notes, like about this Saturday I just tell me what she gonna charge me for the salad dressing.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I say if you get a bone, you don't have to pay.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I'm getting a bow, you don't have to pay, Tom I told me it was $1, and why I gave her $1 right. So, this is an Eastern Market. If you know the people that were sitting down.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:48.000
I said did you have to pay for your suggestion she was like, No, I was like, as I said, Ma'am, they just saw me that I didn't have to pay for. So we will have to pay for the salad dressing.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000
She's awesome is a doll is the daughter I say No, they didn't pay for. So give me my money back. Wow look like you know how you just because like the cashier you can be like on the side.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
I look on the side, I see the doll is still sitting right there so you didn't even put it in, in a drawer, you was gonna pocket it

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
this year.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Yeah.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:22.000
The lady was don't take your dog, I knew she was, she was probably a little pocket because how come you put it in a drawer yet the draw had been open, you know, since that since I have been talking, since I was talking to the lady.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I know had been opened a cover song because people was leaving out, you know what they what they food.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So why didn't you put the dollar in the drawer yet, which which was okay with to the cashier.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
All kinds of salad yes and they put me out with everything on it puts you out. Yes, because I was, you know, in a store like I didn't have to pay for this.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Or they put you out. Yes, because I was, you know, in a store like I didn't have to pay for this. So like you can't go back or just that one day. Now I was just that day. Oh ok, cuz I was still going back one you can walk into stores. Okay. No.
