Okay, um, how many years in Atlanta Have you lived. Seven. Seven years in Atlanta wasn't any other places you live outside of here with the know seven years, just anywhere in life.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Philly jersey.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I spent a couple months in Florida.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Not really know where major. I spent like two weeks in Baltimore.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You know, regular shoes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay cool cool cool.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
As far as education is the highest form of education for you.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One year college.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I really didn't work out too well.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I would about occupation.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Honestly, I'm a husband.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I really don't have an occupation when you got two kids you really can't ever sit occupation. So, whatever. What I want to do though. I'm trying to become a nurse.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's pretty much what I want to do. Yeah, but

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
parents birthplace. My mother and my father were both born and raised in New Jersey.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Okay.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
What do they do for a living.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My mother has her master's in psychology.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And my father is a schema.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Very, very interesting.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Okay, the magic grown up with it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Okay, well I'm, I'm just gonna kind of bounce around, we talked about some of this, some of that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Let's talk about when you first got to Atlanta.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Did you notice any difference between here and other places you live, how much time you got plenty.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yeah, it's, it's a big, it's a big culture shock, especially when you when you were born and raised and grew up a certain way then you come to somewhere where it's the complete opposite is definitely a culture shock, but mostly positive.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Okay. You know I'm saying.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So, is definitely the place like I said, the land opportunity for our people anyway for color people should I say, not necessarily black but just people who a white Puerto Rican is Mexicans black people, you know, Muslims, all of that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
day debt.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
What about

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:55.000
what what is your thoughts on racism, or just race related type of now you said it right the first time racism exists, it's very real and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I'm black so

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'm naturally the target of it I'm a black young female.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I had three strikes against me coming out the womb.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But, it strikes that out. That way with pride. So, it exists, it's real, it's very real here.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Sadly, the shocking part for me though, even though it is very real in the south of experience less racism here then I have gone away.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:44.000
If I'm saying, like, grown a white girl, different ethnicities, were racist against each other, they were trying to but I did not like black people, they are putting people who do not like Mexicans.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, coming here where it's like, know why people don't like colored people it has nothing to it has everything to do with being black but it's not just being black it's colored people, people who are not white are not welcome.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And that's real. And I think once people get over the fact that get over the whole idea of trying to bring us all together and become one and make us all equal or make us equal in their eyes once we get over that fact then we'll be able to conquer this

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.000
whole thing and get past it but until it in. As long as we're trying to become equal to them. We will always be in a struggle with them, their profile.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Let's jump towards family information, do you have any siblings. Yes, I do.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Okay, I have two little sisters and now two little brothers.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Wow, Where do you rank as far as, as, I'm the oldest of everybody.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Okay.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Are you close to your siblings there.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Okay.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Do you have a favorite.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Yes. My younger sister.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
She is my favorite.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Because I've been so involved with her life. Since the day she was born, she was my kid before my kids, my kids, shouts like a.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Sorry about that.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But, yeah, she's been my kids since before my kids or my kids, so that's that's my that's my heart.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But I love all of them just as much but that's my baby.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Okay cool cool cool,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
aunts, uncles grandparents cousins extended family.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I do have a few months, and I say if you literally, maybe two that I am very very close with very close with them, most of summer.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Canada shaky, which is natural, but for the most part I love all my family I love anybody who loves me.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:36.000
ggs. Okay.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Was, which were also culture shock in Georgia.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I went,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I went to a middle school and went to two different middle schools and went to a charter school and then I went to a public Middle School.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Okay, well, just in a capsule between those two.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You don't know anything about them.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You can't teach what you don't know me.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
How can you teach me. You can't teach me what you know because we don't know we don't come from the same place.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You're Joe.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
predominantly colored school.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It was different.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:25.000
They could relate more, they understood, and it was funny because my teacher was a white man, but he spent all his life around African American people, his wife was African American.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So, his father was African American so it wasn't like he was too far off base.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:47.000
My teacher. The white at the white teacher so how can he have a black father. He's a white teacher, why are we talking about biological. Yeah, his biological father was white, but his mother.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I mean it's biological father was black but his mother was right, but he looked, he looked white, white, even like extra weight but he looked like when you looked at us automatically thought why you did not think oh he's black.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now once you got close up on them, you probably be like, oh okay he got curly hair nose not like white people in that green have blue eyes eyes.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
No, he's not. He's not white he's black and Jewish.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Very, very interesting I know we can dive more deeply into that very very so. So, how far was the schools from your career, the charter school was, I want to say about 3035 minutes, a drive.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But the public school was a walk, literally, it was around literally around the corner I can walk up one black I hit a corner and hit another corner and I was at school.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Yeah, I walk every day.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Did you have a little crew with you.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Absolutely no I didn't need a crew when I was, what I did I have a crew at school yeah but I didn't need a crew.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I was cool.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Okay.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
See, says he says on about your crew.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
What is I'll do together.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Again, lot of trouble.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Here, I was a horrible job.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
That's my mother every day, God bless and I love her for putting up with me because I was the worst seemed like you know you use the word horrible.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Cuz I was that kid that you know you had a kid growing up a school that your parents would like stay away from them.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I was that kid.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:19.000
My mom was, if I could call my mother right now she wasn't at work, she would tell you know, I used to have. I used to have to get into verbal borderline physical altercations with people because they just bought a new my child will tell their children

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:31.000
stay away from my child. And she was nothing like that. I was a different person at school and outside in the streets and I was to my mother at home.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
No, he barking and whoever's walking.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:50.000
No sound like Reddit

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So this particular crew of people, how did you guys meet.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
They tried to fight me.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It was two girls.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
one boy who was gay.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And one Puerto Rican girl.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Okay. And the two girls were twins.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And try to fight me.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
way that they want to they want to be best friends with you after that.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They want to fight you they want to be best friends which you have today. Wow, That's cool.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Facebook today

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
will recognize.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And people are going to give respect to those who demanded who export.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Okay, so what about your crew now.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:19.000
How did you meet your crew now that you mentioned to him, mutual friend.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Yeah, surrounded by so many messed up bad people your whole life, you kind of have that urge to just be surrounded by people who just are on the same situation.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
We just want the same things I the life you want and.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I don't really feel the need of the urge to go out, I might go somebody's house kick a watch a game or somebody even cooking out or something like that but you know grown people should I really don't do too much.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Too many clubs I think maybe, I went to a club maybe two weekends ago. And that was my first time going to a club in gear so gears, or slow slow slow.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So, I'm

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
back on the family aspect.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Do you have any memories of traditions growing up.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Thanksgiving.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Thanksgiving was a huge, Huge tradition in my family.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Everybody got together at grandma's house and I mean, everybody, everybody odds uncles twice removed must remove people who just moved in the family for years, cousins I haven't seen him forever.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Everybody came to grandma's house in Jersey and she would turn the whole garage into a buffet and cook and all that other stuff and we drink in and we play it down somebody's playing dominoes in this room's my playing cards and other room.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Somebody, they all goes out back playing dice is Thanksgiving was the thing that was the time where everybody caught up with each other right linked up seeing family members saying see me years, all of that.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Thanksgiving was definitely a tradition.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Like that. Yeah, some everybody Thanksgiving is that was, that was the main event, like we would plan in the beginning of the year for Thanksgiving because it was like who's coming how many bedrooms, do we need how many bowl mattresses how many rooms,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
do we need to rent out how many titles, we need to get.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
We need to get it was definitely event.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Grandma, grandma.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000
That's it. No one else don't bring nothing. No, you can't bring no dish no I don't need your help in this kitchen, nothing, Grandma.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Grandma to it down. That was it, you just come to you eat.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Do you daily plan on keeping those traditions alive your family.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
My family.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000
If I can, I will try, but me and my family we don't have the closest dynamic in the world. Now, so.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Are you new family whenever I family Yeah, not like my new family the people I consider all the all my family so now will I keep that type of tradition alive with my with my family.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Hell yeah. Thanksgiving is definitely popping in my house this year.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:56.000
So, but avoid the majority of family lives in Jersey or as they scattered out throughout the majority of my family is pretty much scattered all around the East Coast, um, but as far as my immediate family.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
They're here, my mom, my dad, my little brothers.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
They're here.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Let's see.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
So we can talk more about some Atlanta stuff.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So, the first neighborhood for this area you came to when you were here.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Awesome. Bro.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Bro, over there on an lm with Georgia,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Georgia.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Was it What was the dynamic out there, the person.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Why, because when you come from somewhere that's so active and you come to somewhere that's so secluded.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It's a shark, especially as a young child, or not even as a young child as a teenager, used to live in their life a certain way used to seeing certain things and hearing things when you come to somewhere where the cross the street instead of it being

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:13.000
a grocery store, I mean instead of me in a corner store, a large amount or whatever is nothing but truth that can be stripped away automatically want as many people around at least people use it was the neighborhood, it was a call with that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
It was the neighborhood, it was the cold with that. Yeah, and that's that's all it was.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And that was like I said, a culture shock for. I've never forget when we pulled up at. On our way. I didn't know when we were pulling into the neighborhood, I did not know that we were pulling into the neighborhood, I thought that we were sitting on the

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
main road to get to wherever we were going.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So when we stopped the truck I thought we were at a truck stop somewhere. So you know rest or whatever and then I get out the car and next thing I know I see my mom and my dad and everybody's getting out the truck and I'm like why we are stopping in and

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
they were like this is it, and I'm like, what's it like now this is where we live in who's living here.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Where's the stores.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Where's the buses where's the cabs where's the trains where's the noise where is the. Where's the sidewalks, where's the sidewalks there's no sidewalks here.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000
So, it was like I said it was definitely an adjustment for sure.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Did you seen safer environment

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
before.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
safer in the sense of.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Way up north, whatever's going on you see it. If there's drugs being sold you see it.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Police ran by helicopters, fire, fire department crackers outside screaming arguing with each other drugs on the corner.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Yelling smashing bottles, all that you see you here it's directly from your face cannot be avoided.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Down here.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:15.000
You don't see that there is no crackheads on the corner, there is no one knows walking up and down the block, there is no, there isn't that. Now, in that aspect yes it did seem safer but like I said that's the beauty and the beast of being here, because

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
just because you know see it doesn't mean anything happen.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
You just don't see it.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That's it.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
That's it. Definitely.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Listen.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Listen. I thought I was like oh it's great down here it's safe it's peaceful it's long Behold, I believe, between three to six months of me first moving here somebody found a girl in the woods to maybe like two minutes from where I was living.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So I was just like, oh okay so they get it popping down here they just don't get it popping in front of your face but it's going, it's going down. And then once I got to get out and explore the neighborhood that I was in more I realized like Oh, no.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Y'all got y'all just cover it up with trees and grass and really nice houses.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
dialect.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Can you say because the thing is obvious but do you feel like there's a difference between a jersey in Atlanta dialect.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Yes. Okay.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And can you tell if somebody is from Jersey just by the way they talk. Yes.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
You can tell somebody from Atlanta, just by the way. Absolutely.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Okay, what are some of the unique words from Jersey that people use

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
john john kwn john.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Okay john with me. The thing that place I'm about to go to the gym

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
or.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Remember that john I was past that day remember john. We walked past that day and she said I said john is a universal word. Okay.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So that's something that I got on us. I don't say john

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:27.000
right color for you, boys. You buy you lacking right now. lacking lacking.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
know what that means you want some of the shit that means you you.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That means you tweaking.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Okay. If I'm saying that's a southern word tweaking that's that's y'all you tweaking right.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Well maybe that yeah that might be jersey that's something that I say tweaking right now or you bugging you wiling out.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
You Ellen right now.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
You want some other shit like that's basically what that means.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Down here is Charlotte trippin around the mother she is.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Okay, now that's that's a great point. Now here is more of phrases. I want to hear what you feel is some of the phrases and words as far as in Atlanta, birth fuck you got going on.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Okay.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:35.000
When somebody says something to someone like I've been hanging out with a lot of males. So when I hear men talk to each other I can pretty much guess, especially that I can pretty much guess off the top of my head what they're going to say next.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And usually wherever they're say everybody else is about to say the same thing so everybody else bus I laugh when I was about to say the same damn thing bro What the fuck you got going on.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Saudi trippin evil I'm saying, like, so I could turn it on, turn it off but it's like I say it's phrases straight like that, y'all, y'all are more of phrases, as we have words, we can say one word, and it means exactly what we're you know exactly what

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
we're talking about, from Jersey, Jersey. Now here, y'all could say a phrase, with the way you say no but the way you say you know exactly what the person is talking about.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Like if somebody say hey Bry what you're doing are just kicking ship.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000
You know exactly what they're doing. They the children at the house, or they say I'm just kicking shoot which are hn somewhere but they go.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
If you a Jersey, Jersey, which is nine colon and

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Nine colon and that means I'm chillin with my girl it's the same thing, but y'all say a different way.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:00.000
You got any funny stories about language or whatever, whatever. Yes. Okay, okay. So, when I first moved down here, I can say, I've moved into a neighborhood so you got to get get to know everybody in the sec that's, that's another Georgia thing, y'all,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:15.000
y'all get to know your neighbors, like up north, we see somebody poor neighborhood we like would forget that. They are here yes it's my opinion they were young, pay attention y'all I oh that's me of like 20 years I went to school with a kid like some

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
shit like that. So when I first moved down here.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I was getting no right and they were in, and never forget him I still talk to him to this day, his name was called.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And you smoke weed and sip a lot of drink at one point in time. So, I would catch the first word, and the last or up everything you said.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And I could never understand what he's saying. It was like as if he just blended all the words into one long as we're so I used to be like, I used to literally have to tap on homie be like him.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And they were like no what he said was, he was about the goal here and pick up this person that he was going come back over here. And over there but you know I'm saying that's what he said he's cool cool cool.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Oh wow.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So I was like, after like I said, being here for a couple years, it starts the register.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So it's like okay now nobody's talking about but when I first got there here I was like, Brad You sound like he just said a bunch of different like he's just he just mumbled he said the first word and last word and everything in between was just one biggest

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
number.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And this is when he was so great used to play. What did he just say they just called me a bit.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And they like nah nah he call you bitch, he call you a bit he just he just said we're bitch but he call you a bit and I'm like, Okay.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Are away here we was listening to the radio, and that racks and racks came on. Yeah, when it first came out, I didn't even understand what the hell future was talking about, I did do that whole song that's cool that you did, I had to read the lyrics oh my god that he had, I had to look really clearly, I

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:27.000
clearly, I had to look up some lyrics I had to never forget it because I remember going on YouTube and be like, Yo, this song goes so hard. I need to figure out what pain cuz I know he's saying something worth saying, so when I figured out the lyrics

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I was like oh yeah folks with the song so clear to me now but back then it was if I went, but def come from years of listening to the future and understanding his lingo to the point where you know what he's saying now.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
No, definitely, definitely.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
See what games did you play, I guess, either. Most yourself or with your friends.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
When you mean like, here are their

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
games in particular.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:11.000
See, I grew up really rough. So, the girl that I have like boys and then I was boys. So, we didn't play the kidney games the hide and go seek, we slept boxer.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:27.000
If I'm saying, we, we teach each other how to shoot dice we playing checkers we, we don't shit like that, that's, like, we're not really playing hide and go seek or Tic Tac Toe or double the double dutch that was the ship.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
We did that.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Yeah, but yeah double dutch stuff like the hopscotch we definitely did have got. We put our own little spin on it.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
We play four quarters, lot of basketball, volleyball.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Um, but yeah I hung out with mostly boys so it was like I was really, really didn't. I really wasn't into the Let's Play Game thing it was more like, let's get into some shit.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Hello open. Yes, career.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Yeah, I did. I just love doing it, it really wasn't that that did not sign up for the team and basketball I'm not like that, that really wasn't my thing I just.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:28.000
My mom is amazing at the sport and she loves the sport and it made me love the sport, so I just, I like playing for fun I like watching it, but as far as me joining the team that was never really my thing only team that joined was the football team.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:44.000
you got a favorite team, basketball, either sport NFL football, baseball, I have to say, even though I know they're probably going to choke at some point in time this year I bleed green.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I love the Eagles.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
I can't help it.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
My grandfather was a huge ginormous fan of the Jets.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And the Giants he loved the New York Giants love the New York giant

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:11.000
basketball, I pretty much don't have a specific team. I'm more of a players type because now it's like one life.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I love the golden warriors Golden Gate warriors. Close enough, wherever they are, but I don't do teams, I love Steph Curry. That is my dude. Do you hear what I'm saying.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Kevin Duran. That's my, the Holy Trinity I love all three of them, but I love Steph Curry and I love Steph Curry long before he one, I mean I was the Steph Curry fan.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I was a Steph Curry fan long before he one lump for immediate all these other people started wearing yellow and blue and white. Now, I was a fan of him I loved him long before all of this happen.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
So, I'm more of a player's fan. I love LeBron I love Kevin.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I love the way and I love Bosh, I love all of them, like I love to I'm more of a player's type of person I'm not really a team anymore.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Like I'm glad that the team one of my favorite player on though but I'm more of a player type of that I don't really like teams anymore. Yeah.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Okay. Do you think was long between the random brown right now, like they bought the team was by the individual player at this point. So, I'm more of a player's saying I'm more of a team fan but NFL I'm more of a team fan.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And I love the egos today.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Did you catch the solar eclipse the other day. Yes it did you look at it without the glasses. Yes, it was as feeling today. Amazing. Okay.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:57.000
People think they can do things just because they don't, if you, if you train your body to get used to something you'll be able to build up a tolerance for it just like people say oh I don't drink, but you see everybody else is drinking wine because they

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
built up a tolerance for I'm pretty sure at one point and they didn't drink either.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:15.000
You know, saying so has nothing to do what really, you can, as black people we have a lot of power, and I know that sounds really cheesy but we have a lot of power there are things that we can do that other cultures, other beings cannot do.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.000
and for them to say Oh, be careful of the sun don't look into the sun because they might hurt your eyes, your eyes We are some people.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
You know I'm saying, so you telling me not to listen to the scientists I'm going to go blind that sounds stupid. My ancestors where I come from, we are some people.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Why can I look into the sun.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Don't stare at it for three hours or three minutes but you can look up at the clip. Wow.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I missed out on the wonderfulness of something.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:34:02.000
It's a shadow, the biggest global shadow, not really that big of a deal. I mean, the only reason that people make such a big deal because it happens every bajillion years, but a number of worldwide biggest shadow.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
You want to see Eclipse Hill glorified around this time.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
That's exactly what it feels like.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I want to say that it says supposed to be another one coming in a few years, in a few years. We got a problem if there's another one coming. we got to.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
We got more to worry about any clips.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
If another one comes in a few years. I'm not going outside. I said I'm with you. We're going to be all black and it's gonna be inside this house.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Yay.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Okay. All right. This probably be the last follow up question before Have you read maybe one or two passages. That's cool. I'm.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Where might you go

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
restaurant as hard because all the food here so damn good life.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Lord is so hard to pick one place to eat here because it's like, it's so many places I go get the blue.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:23.000
And there's so many amazing things to see here, that's the difference between Atlanta, Georgia in itself in other places is so much here is so much to offer here.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:37.000
If people just really look at don't look at it for what it is look at it like Georgia has a lot of culture, Atlanta has a lot of culture and it's a lot of different races and different artists with a lot of things to offer So, going to a dinner in a movie

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:51.000
that's considered boring nowadays now it's like going for drinks and going to an art exhibit like just not too long ago, me and my boyfriend we went to a thing called sip and stroke in Atlanta, where apparently you drink and you get taught how to paint

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
like that's the normal thing to do now.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
You know I'm saying that we went to the Ferris wheel afterwards like that's the normal thing to do now.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
What brother, Ben is awesome so that's another Atlanta, Georgia.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I used to hate it now I'll use it like every other fitness bra bra, that's y'all, I don't care what nobody say that is y'all

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:29.000
know everybody got a long time away with y'all dog created in and trended the bra, no one else I don't care what nobody has the people were saying, bro.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Not brother nobody was saying. It's still want to y'all from me is that, but.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And that's what everybody said, that's when it became contagious, but everybody was saying bro females.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:37:13.000
That's what, but I noticed that once the female started doing it, that's when y'all stopped, like, No, I mean we kept saying, y'all say Machado saying that one female say I'll be like,
