00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Alright, so it is September 10.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, let's start the beginning and tell me about where you began so maybe you can start by just telling you when were you born.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay. I was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay, the 14th Street.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I asked when when when I was February February 27 1979 29.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Mm hmm.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So tell me about your family's history like how did they end up living.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What's your parents Yeah, um, it's funny. Both my parents, I'm not migrated but you kind of from Harlem.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
They were one of those.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A lot of families that were looking to where I will honestly it was that was my grandmother's were single mothers and they were trying to find more opportunities.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
there was housing opportunities over here. Yeah.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And so a lot of people, that's I think I can see like the history of it was like, the more Jewish the Jewish population was actually blocking the Queens into the suburbs they were leaving, and then the Hispanic in the end, and black population started

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:13.000
moving further down and spreading out, because it was for housing opportunities away. So I bought my grandma's, sometimes we came to the Lower East Side,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and came to loot to lower east side from, from same neighborhoods in Harlem.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And so, no. And then it was funny because all they knew each other. And it's funny the new children later on, get together and have me, right, but they.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So they knew each other for years and then my mother, my father met just happenstance like, you know, years later on. Yeah.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Yeah, they met on the Lower East Side. And actually, you can on in Jackson Park. Yeah, there's a tree with their initials in it from when they were little kids.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They were high school sweethearts your high school sweethearts. And then that's again the now.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But the tree, and the initials is still in there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Crazy. Yeah, because they'll go back there. Look at that. Yesterday, so what's your like ancestry or your. Do you like to the African American, just, I hate to use those boxes and we have to.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm just curious Yes, I did another project in the Bronx, and it was really interesting because everybody was really mixed, you know there was like one grandmother was from, you know, Jamaica and other grandmother was from, you know, Atlanta had these

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
like really interesting histories of.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Nope.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Both my parents both my parents.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They just, we are hate to say that we're African American so soon I like that word. I mean think about it like it's fundamentally

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:15.000
just perpetuating the social social construct. Yeah, it's like African Americans, Africa, Africa as a whole continent. Yeah, plethora of, you know, beliefs and cultures and dialects, and to, to give it back to me and neatly name like, Oh, you know what,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
in the past, you know, we, your predecessors we pulled from your country in Boise enslaved.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And you know we'll give you that Africa they, you know like, not not specific like, I don't have any regions that I'm you know just Africa, just Africa.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Yeah, so games like like.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I like to quote by Brown.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Brown.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I think that we can get to a better direction that way.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Hey man, everybody's Brown, got some different color. it's brown, Brown and so right.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:02.000
You know, I like that way better, because just just worry too much. Yeah, I'm just saying that just for like, for the purpose of the interview but man, I use I usually say I'm Brown.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Brown person but I did. I don't I don't most of my family's from the south. Yeah, and then.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Yeah. We are family unions are, you know, I just like the last one that we had. But we have from the millions and every year we go different places, but a lot of the families found this out.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
my, my father front of my last name. A lot of people have my last name in Panama,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
with their and a phone book hammer last name.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But it was so weird because in America I've never or very rarely are people with my last name.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And my father put two s's at the end, he put the other s at the end is like

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:11.000
double double. And then, even if you Google my name. A lot of people who have have one s. Yeah. And then when I go to Panama. Yeah, there's some that had to SS It was weird.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It was very crazy but it was cool and it was cool to see that and then just being in, I looked like, like the people, nobody knew he was asking me what I was when I was, I was from.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And I'm like, really crazy small, far, far away.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's an island. It's far and it's crazy.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's crazy, where they look like me siloed, I feel like my father could be from Panama I did ask him and he doesn't know much about his father now know much about him

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
with your mom.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I grew up my mom, I grew up with her, and she raised four of us have siblings have two older brothers and a younger sister. She's 28.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And we, my older brothers are 3236 3536.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The overseas the welcome.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It was four of us have already kind of like when I was three addicted to drugs.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Heroin and crack

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is one of my time, great, but he may have insulted it's funny because I was open for six years.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I just started talking to him about like for four months ago.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
To do that, it's funny.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We were we're doing.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We're taking classes where we're trying to combine like

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the martial arts trainings with community organizing the aspects of it. And one of the things that we're doing is, it does it is, and actually learning martial law.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yeah, we're learning how to use that though, to center ourselves in our work, whatever we're learning. It's actually spilling into our personal lives, and that's one of the Corolla reserve it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I am I am talking to my father now because I'm thinking more about my energy, and I was used, and it was way more negative energy used to hate him. And it was to love him.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Yeah, so it's like a less. I even feel like less energy being used with

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:39.000
an hour ago and I mean I've had scanning, everybody else. I'm so aware of all the socio economic conditions, but when it's right in front, you know, means it's directly affecting me I've.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I was like not consistent with that, like, I was not consistent with that my life. So, that's what starts all over again. Yeah. Where is he is to learn a word to as well.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And it's funny because the way you found him, I found him in 1990. We got to start talking back in 1997. Yeah.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
right before I went to college. Yeah.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And he, We found them because we lost my cat.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And it was my senior high school that Boy George goes Boy George, my senior high school, and I'm worried about my cat, I got midterms and everything and my cat is missing and I'm going crazy.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And he was one of those cats. This is the city, he will go out, he will go out to the windows and he will do some crazy stuff and sometimes go all throughout the building but he would come back yeah he would start crying back at the door like he always

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
came back, but somebody wanted to do maintenance.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:45.000
But we found him, he took him to put him in a basement for rats. They took my cat and put them down here for rats, my cats.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But we'll record when I was with my sister now door knocking looking for my cat.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And that's how I found my phone like oh street from me. I'm like, the door. No, actually when it was like it's like a, it's like one of them houses where all the people do the drugs and everything yeah crack spot.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And, but we didn't know that anyone who's knocking on the door, and somebody said, I think those are your kids outside.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And my sister and I looked at him was like, daddy.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
dad's house, and we just stood there still, I didn't was was showing up.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We found them again. And it was like, Oh,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that's great, because he's got it. So he still lives in the neighborhood. And it was right across street from my mom like literally well now she moved further, she moved to another smaller apartment, so he doesn't live in the same development, they live

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000
literally in the same development you know I live in.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It was from. Yeah.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah. Okay. He still lives there. And, yeah, my mother.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.000
My mother is heat my father doing at work so if you actually volunteered yesterday for the elections, you know, I got him to help him.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Yeah, I got him involved he got to see a little more what I do. Yeah. And

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000
my mother. She's, she's a social worker in the Lower East Side social worker for secret. She's.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000
She's close to retiring closely in a 30 year mark boy. Yeah, so she's, she's been helping parents at a Head Start program.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's great. So she's still here and she works in the neighborhood, and I'm here and I'm working to enable

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I live, I live where I live

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
now.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And I used to live my sister, but she just moved out.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And, yeah, that is good. I mean, it's probably kind of cool right yes cool because you know when you leave in the morning and then you come back and like everything's back when you left it exactly, that's, that's what's making me is making you more account

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:21.000
like nah can't blame things on my sister like throw out the garbage me know.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Okay, we like yes is splitting me is putting things into perspective my gosh it man I gotta people come over I gotta make sure my point.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But, yes, she is cool we wanna tell me like, what do you remember that being a kid.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I know it's so funny, is this is a memory that's good so funny you just said, there's a memory, that's good and bad itself. Okay.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
When we were little, we played this game called colors. Okay, what does it take before you have to I was living together we was friends and we have grown up together.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Before we left associated pick a color, what color purple.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Sure, I'm great. Okay, we walk out, and we count how many crack vials we see with that.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay, so if you.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So we will get ready to go to this post office.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:28.000
By the time we got to the post office and back.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But either way, that's almost Jones was in this neighborhoods where they will crack balls everywhere, drug legals that was, that was a common thing grass so you didn't play in grass.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You kept on grass, because the place where dogs crap that yeah yeah jug needles in it. Yeah and incorrect balls. They look like little perfume. It looks like a little perfume quite lost and where they're all different colors, different colors.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So every normal color you pick our motto was always purple, purple,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
purple, purple, purple, I said, I had like I had like this.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
This decides to like not Purple's a cut, everybody gets really did.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But so yeah it was purple, and this was in school yards in in churches in any type of grass over here, there was drug needles and crack vials and all of that in there.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Oy, where does he play. That's a funny, so we played in talks that we still play in these parks Okay, we still play these parks so yeah we still like everyone say like, it was this is a negative part of it but I remember that.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:41.000
That was fun. It was a fun game, you know, not knowing the real applications of it. even when we played.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I remember cases with a freakin drug needle. He picked it up and without an AIDS was around was like you know you didn't know about AIDS much but it was I can do that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:08.000
nice sorry right yeah. But there was drug needles, more Naga when I got older I play basketball. Yeah. And the way we played VSV still booms from the maintenance men.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Yeah, and clean up works. Before we played on them. They had to clean the grass, we got to clean the glass.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And we will beg the donkeys, but you will make like agreements with them like man, please will be in his corner man, because going to get on the court is going to get on the court man, please pno corner.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Just be over there.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And these were all men that were attached to families.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But they were like the serious public drug users. And then some of them will have alcohol problems, some of them were dicta other types of drugs, but it was still a community, which is oddly enough, yeah, they still like I still go walk we walked by the

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000
basketball court right now. And there's those guys are still in Estonia Sydney, everything's changing around them, but they're still there, an economy shows the joke around so David like we all joking.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But that they were looking, they were looking at me and watch me grow up and, yeah, they still even make dumb conversation asked me from what happened to basketball, but these are the people that this was my neighborhood, this will be played at those

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that I remember, so I mean it sounds like you necessarily feel unsafe even being in this kind of unsafe environment, you knew what to do when my mother, when I walked in my building as a little girl, we had to ring the bell before we walked in the building

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
some other knew that he was in the building.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
When we was leaving the building, we had to ring the bell when we left the building. So know that we made it out of the building.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The building was the girl was saying, This is what she needed you know, we had Tycho's when, when we were at home we go for no one, not even family members, money, I got my cousin in one day.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And I was like oh he's my family. My mother told me you do not open the door for anyone anybody. Nobody, nobody. So I got in trouble for that once I'm always travel appears like my sister now he's always on work with each other.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:17.000
When we are Walkmans right you couldn't you couldn't hold it out like now and you had to not have it loud because somebody might come up and run up on you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
When you.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You kept the quarter, my mother may so he kept quarters title not little boss, so we could call it a payphone in case of emergency. Yeah. And, you know, we I just never, I never felt.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I felt like they had those fears but I knew that like there was these things that I had to do like a set of rules. Rules yeah when you guys on the blog you didn't go to the whole block were looking back at least once, and never did that, and it makes

00:17:45.000 --> 00:18:00.000
to me. You know he was taught that you will not block, you look you check yourself take you somewhere else every once in a while. These are things that we just raised up with. I remember throwing out the garbage. There was a junkie guy, he was running away from people shooting at him.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And we are just going to stop me I just been me I literally just throw we would throw the garbage. Why I just went away from automation.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And I remember like him breathing so hard and and sweating, and he was, it was, we heard those thoughts and then I figured we would probably like I was the guy that was.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:28.000
But I remember some of the garbage. And I remember being like this little girl, my assistant athletic director together like we can go in, they will get together

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000
with I remember us like just knowing what to do. I remember this knowing like don't think in the mind at calm, at what he's not even here, and thought the garbage, and I was terrified by remember like just be like, oh, we're going to go and harness literally

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000
But I remember like just being like, oh, we're going to go and literally talk like he wasn't like giving your heart out of breath, you were talking like yeah, the food is good.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:04.000
We both knew me when we never looked each other once so know what I mean we just keep it moving. Don't act like you don't see it all the garbage I really you know he's dead, they know exactly what the drug dealers they they sold drugs in the buildings.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
All the time there's drug drug dealer I'm talking about huge operations. Yeah, on every floor you we.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah, so used to be in the hallway we used to play out in the hallway to that was not a safe place where I'm hallway. And when we will go by, some people will come invited to get the drugs you would see tons of money on the table and it was just, we couldn't

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
think about it.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Did you ever have any experiences that affected you personally like any of this stuff like by violence fights, whatever like touch you you know you saw it but I saw you know I saw it, but I never touched it, even when I was older My mother was like nine

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:00.000
o'clock, you're going to be okay with money in front of the door. Yeah, not not not not no one o'clock. And if I came in and no one, one day without the phone 950 59 3030 days without the phone.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And if you want to knock off some days you have to clean out the cabinets and rearrange the linen closet to knock on wood, but that's what.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yes, he was tough but so never really I mean I have to, I have to really think about what my brother was attacked a lot my brother is also homosexual.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And that may, that was a that is made it. I just added that just add a field, and I watched my mother struggle with that, you know, so really trying to worry about her son wasn't accepted in the community.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It wasn't safe for him. So like he came home, you can call him a couple of times beat up jumped in at one point is husband who is still with today, they still together it was there, they're going on like 1617 years old, 18 years, I'm going to discredit

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
they had together for a long time.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And at the time he was actually staying with us too and I remember him coming home one day and he's a, he was a foster kid and displace that his community and my mother.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000
My mother is also take everybody into that I learned like I have to share spaces with people.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I will come in the morning and always have people on the floor living in my house, my cousins next door neighbors. You know, so that's how it touched me too.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
So like my brother He came all beat up a couple of times.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:33.000
My cousin's guide says on stuff. My father is addicted to drugs. So what does that mean like the people that were around me sometimes when

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000
I see people like my mother one day, I remember this Donkey Lady Kiss Me and my mother makes a big database she's like oh yeah daughters so cute.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And mommy's tummy never the kiss was like she was strict with everything yeah it was it was like, she keeps me and my mother, she literally went crazy.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Oh, bye.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Bye,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
wash my face you took me took me to the doctor gave us kitchen, I was a big thing was like no no Don't touch my shoulders.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
These things, touching on my brother got beat up my other brother. I once had a gun pulled out on me, but it was like, if I think about it, it was this guy's name is.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And I was, he was transferred to one of my little friends, he's my brother's age. Yeah, he should I talked to my little friend. And I was like, I was like really like outspoken, I still am, but you know, I was more like what, and I said to him, Rabbi

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:42.000
cinema my business I said, that's a little girl messing when you got enough girls your age, that little girl that's nasty. And we were still young, he probably was 16 or 15 at the time he was still a young kid we all still little kids but he had a gun,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
he had a gun. And he came up to me.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000
He pulled out on me he was like you need to open need to shut your mouth, or take a particular you and your end goal, and he said, I'll take care of us, and get your brother.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And that's what I realized like.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:08.000
That's just like that's a condition in my community, and my brother. I realize I need to never do that again never open my mouth and put my family a risk is here is my brother.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:22.000
My brother was a basketball player and that's what made him cool he could dunk. He was fast and that's where everybody respected and that's what he got his respect not from someone Jones or anything like that. And that's what it is that's what his thing was like man I'll shoot your podcast brother to and what it made me realize me in the community I was in certain roles with

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000
the community I was in certain roles with guns and, you know, my brother could could could potentially be, you know, could have gotten killed because of that.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Yeah, you know, so, and then that's not even counting all the little hood fights that happen but nothing crazy nothing like really crazy actually directly affected me and so later on, when I came back to the neighborhood from college.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Okay. So you went away. Yeah went away. Okay.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And then, I mean what was

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
everything,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:13.000
every day, and it was more like, you know, you know, if you look at this painting right this famous in the you stand really close to it, you could admire all the detail of everything, and all the colors.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And it just took a while for me to really step back and see what was happening my neighborhood, you know, and then see the whole full picture. So look very beautiful at, at the time.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yeah. And when you say revitalise like these, I put in the night. I've been doing these when I do workshops I'm like let's put down some new bad curse words like revitalize like D costs and treat like these are these new bad words that we didn't we never

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
knew what were hurt us revitalize our community that sounds great. Sounds pretty good. Yeah, but no, it's not gonna always be, you know, positive things that are coming out of that.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
and when when I first went off went out.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I remember like programs are thriving. Yeah. And I remember our kids were very involved in. And I noticed to like this is some seriously funding stuff started getting cut from programs, locally.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:22.000
This is like maybe like like almost like 20 years ago, when Giuliani and the tacky cutting programs tremendously. Yeah, in a neighborhood.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And that affected a lot. I used to coach basketball.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I was one of those. That's nothing that's memory. When I was a little girl is is tomboy. And there was like ice always come and there's like, you know what, if you want little girl because I kept saying one little girls they say you know what you want

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
little girls, go get them.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
That's it. Oh, and then if I get a little girls we could have a team.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:57.000
So let me I'd like to tell you right my homegrown still to this day we still work together, actually like she works with us, and I work here but we've actually bridge those gaps she has her youth come and organize with us and do organize a public housing

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:10.000
with both of us went and we did recruiting for you, for girls and we came up with all these little girls. Yeah, they will none of our little our age. So one of the committee Junior coaches and we started our own little program, this is this is this is

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
very true.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Literally, I was like probably like 14 1515, and we had a team that we had practices, and we had the gym on certain hours for certain, certain days we did it.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:37.000
We did it, but I used to I used to coach basketball, and one of the little girls that we coached they frankly now they have babies and, and they are not and I mean much I said that was the nlb awful programs but they didn't have no anywhere to go.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:27:07.000
When we cut that program there was really nothing for those little kids to do. Yeah. And so I came back and not a lot of them are pregnant and addicted to Joe.
