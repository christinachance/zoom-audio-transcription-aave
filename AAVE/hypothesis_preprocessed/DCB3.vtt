She's a little crazy, she would always tell me that if she ever left.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Just remember that she's always watching man she told me that even if she passed, or even when she passed away, that she will always be there on my side.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Did you see that kind of those good qualities in your foster mind?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Sometimes it depends on like if she's hollering I don't like people yelling, but I like the you.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
What do you like to do for fun I like the day every since I've been with the dance team?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
I just like to dance. Why are you not so on dazzling?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Because I want to be on past. I thought I would be nervous left.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I don't know. I think case is just too changer for me.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I could dance, and all. but cash is a whole different ball game from the boys.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Are girls cook dancing. my Mom didn't have the money to pay for gas.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Jessica something that you want to do. Is it something that you want to do?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
But you know if it's something that you really want to do there are people who will help you right?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Yes, you know that. Yes, you know that's one of the reasons that you come to the club is so you because you have people who care about you and want to see you.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Do? Well, yes, hey, somebody's ringing the doorbell

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So let me ask you this because i've heard 2 different things. Now, first you tell me because it's too challenging.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
But then, you tell me it's about the money is about the money, or because it's too hard to challenge it, and because even if I wanted to do it, it would be challenging and my Mom don't have the money, for okay,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
so forget the money. let's say you had the money so it's no longer about the money.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Would you be up for the challenge? Well, yes, you know nobody.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Why not i'll just be too nervous wow you're beautiful.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You're talented. There is nothing that's different from you than all those other girls on the team.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
You just have to work hard. Do you want a heart, do you?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
If you want it bad enough. You can do anything you want I don't really want to do it because i'm already one of the guys team that's different.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
That's different. But I know I think there's something else there.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
But we know i'm gonna let that go right now i'm gonna let go right now.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm gonna ask you again, though I shouldn't get let it go right now.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
How do you get around, Metro? You add the trainer.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:28.000
The bus both. When was the first time you rode the train the first time I wrote the train was when my mom and my uncle to my little cousin a party at Chucky's cheese How old are you like 11

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
20. Well, how were you when you first run the bus? Oh, no!

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Like much younger, probably like 5, 6 my mom yeah so it's like but now you write it by yourself.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Do. Most kids like ride the metro ride the bus and training by themselves.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
What's the craziest thing you've seen on Metro nothing.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
You don't see crazy stuff on metro when people are riding train down to stick yourself.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I think the one I saw a man taking his clothes off on the train, and I was like, Oh, Lord!

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Is he going? Is he gone? The craziest thing I saw in the news when I made it through that year on that bus driver, so I didn't I see this what happened? The lady told the bus driver for the lady to have a

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
good day, and she turned around. actually 2 year an hour. Where does she get the urine from?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
She went to a vacuum bus and peanut in the cup. So she got back on the bus.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
First you got one of us. Oh, and you went to the back of the bus to use the director in a cup shooting when it's time for you to get off.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
She walked to the front of the bus, go past the back door, walk to the front of the bus, and the bus driver tells her, Have a nice day, man.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And they just turns around and throw the p one you're gonna hear about that.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:04.000
No, When was this? This was like some weeks ago? for what?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Because she was mad. He said she had a nice heaven like that, because they told her to have a nice day.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
She wouldn't have thought pona you know i'm gonna stop telling you to have a nice day. hey? You can't even tell people have a nice day no more.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Were you at the club and all that stuff was going on at the Benny Road metro like when they had that big fight yourself, where maybe maybe this was last summer, like maybe a year ago.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Yeah, it wasn't this summer, Maybe it was like last spring remember all the stuff was happening with the police and stuff.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I mean they had a whole big riot like on the buses and stuff.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But then they had a whole big like. It was a big big fight at the Metro.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000
At any room i'm working here. It was crazy there's like 2 300 people down there.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
It was really bad I heard about when it was a right at HD.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And something like that shot where you were. There,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I was a greater. What happened? Raw program between kind of work from crater when they go Shooter?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Is that a big thing? No, no more close it out in a second. it's hood beef like a big thing, and easy Sometimes it depends on where you are.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Be so. tell me about it. I don't even know what to be, for I don't give it to that.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
But tell me about just in general what's some like some that you know of, like some little beast.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:14.000

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:26.000

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
So they don't beef in the club but they beef when they leave.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:54.000
So how does that work? So they cool in the club go outside, and it's all like i'm ready to fight you no good to put baby cooler sometimes, but if they see it's like, if I and you hope But we just
