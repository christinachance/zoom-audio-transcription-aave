Okay.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Are you close to any of your grandparents cousins.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I love them, but everybody just pretty much get the old thing going on so you know you grow older ages, you know, start.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Pretty much, yeah doing your own thing.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And it was more so to older people and so you want to see for a check out you know.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Um, let's see.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Blah blah blah blah blah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
brothers two sisters,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Who's younger or older where you reside in the mix. I'm the oldest girl, and the second oldest Adam only got one big brother, everybody else younger than me.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But my big brother he grew up with his mom so, and then the other for that is so much younger so like them personally is this always had a boy.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Okay. Did you feel like you got away with more things that you did or you got away with more things.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Um,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Get Away with Murder is conscious is not like my.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So your one friend in particular, what do you do together. Small workout, he talked about boy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
How do you meet a sixth grader.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Over a decade.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Let's see.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
about a school. How was school for you coming up.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:27.000
score was. What, what you made it at my school well it was a little bit, let me tell you it was like, in the beginning, it was good, it was excellent school you know we was all cool the day you got to folks moving in from crazy areas that you got everybody

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
else around it are you growing a venture analysis.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So it's like one day you might have. We might make what is it called, we might meet our criteria, or something. The next day, they want to food or some like the

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
next day you know you got these gang members quote unquote coming in and as a school like warrior word for.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I guess what grade was that happened.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That was like seventh grade.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Saving Grace.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Read this.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
How many students used to go to classes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Well, I always well when I got in high school article AP classes were throughout middle school. It was like 30 in 40 keys in Nicholas.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It needs to be so high, but in high school, like 10 people in my class.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Sometimes, 28, the most okay that's a good thing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
What kind of services be to take.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Of course the basic math, reading science, social studies, the biology AP geometry AP, whoever else

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:13.000
out of different mass and then they had of course biology, chemistry, physical science and economics,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
middle school, high school,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
college

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is like Tim Curry.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000
You remember them from classes. Question. Remember math because that's your money.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
English, stuff like that. Literature stuff like the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:59.000
broad range of vocabulary aa opens your mind to against believe in date, in and of course the history is the you that you know some history, what our history really is our history but the you hear different aspects and different point of views as you

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000
grow older. Indeed you eventually get your own mind, say, in chemistry and science and stuff like that. I'm really go for on it because I got a real weak stomach.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But everything else was everything else was pretty cool.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You got to be a certain type of individual to be a doctor. Yeah, and I had my major was gonna be nursing, my I switch my major as soon as I said in classes on my own Muslim begins to week I was in those classes, they're trying to get us the data like

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I hate this

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
kind of

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
switch to social work.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And there's still something in yourself as well.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That's what I do, that's what I did.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
See, what was your favorite subject matter.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Not just because of money but just because that's always been the subject that I could like I could understand this like my grandma markers is a used to pay me, the dude a map or, like,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Oh, yeah.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
My mom is

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
my mom a real father man.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Only when my daddy real smart witty too but he he don't know like this was they added a lot of letters or not it, there's two there's two different type of man.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Yeah.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But he can add up some numbers in his head in a heartbeat.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
What kind of bad, you take you know I'm just looking at a map.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Anyway, years

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
See, Donald Trump is the president,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
President Obama is my president okay.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Obama is my president.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I'm really you know the type of person I am. You know I give people the benefit of the doubt. So, yeah,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Maybe,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:05.000
maybe, just maybe Burgess damn maybe

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
did a park Obama.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
The president for eight years, he can say black people.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Everybody

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
stopped working with black people.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
You

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000
to say why he just like me black people I didn't say that but now I mean he doesn't help everybody.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Let me ask you that Obamacare.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
They try to make it

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
right.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000
within the same day I see about Obamacare now means I said like that now they switch to the Donald Trump.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Yeah.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Right. He just want to relay back over there.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Yo this type of stuff.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
me too deep and policies that are we listening to it.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:54.000
But I'll never really have a response,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
passing bills, making paper.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
You know more than what it is, again, a timeout.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Somebody needs to put Obama on the $25 bill. Where is Obama Tony.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
