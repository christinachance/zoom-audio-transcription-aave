00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
i'm interested only in the present the boy was surprised I'm.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A woman of the desert, she said, averting her face.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But he had to move on. Thank you, said the boy, the boy, turned to the hand that rode.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
All don't know the desert that Well, yet because i've always heard about them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The boy answered, saying nothing about his dream sadly. My dream of becoming a squirrel whisper may never happen.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The boy looked out at the horizon. They had understood each other perfectly well.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But the merchant understood what the boy had said. He thought of all the married shepherds he had known.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
3 armed tribes been approached and asked, with the boy and the alchemist were doing there.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Some of those who saw its flight said it traveled with a hissing sound.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was the first time either had touched the other. Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books, he answered.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He knew how to share them, and how to slog with them.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They were looking only for gold, his companion answered, A man into the wind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The caravan moved toward the east. Everything in life is an omen, said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading.
