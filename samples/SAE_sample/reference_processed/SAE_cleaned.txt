i am interested only in the present
the boy was surprised
i am a women of the desert she said averting her face
but he had to move on
thank you said the boy
the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
i do not know the desert that well yet
because i have always hear about them the boy answered saying nothing about his dream
sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen ten the boy looked out at the horizon
and they had understood each other perfectly well
the dunes are changed by the wind but the desert never changes
he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
but the merchant understood what the boy had said
he thought of all the married shepards he had known
three armed tribes been approach and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
some of those who saw its flight said it traveled with a hissing sound
he had always believed the sheep were able to understand what he had said 
it was the first time either had touched the other
well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
he knew how to sheer them and how to slaughter them
they were looking only for gold his companion had answered
or a man into the wind
he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
the caravan moved towards the east
everything in life is an omen said the english man now closing the journal he was reading
